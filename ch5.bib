  abstract = {We present a new differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry algorithm for monitoring the temporal evolution of surface deformations. The presented technique is based on an appropriate combination of differential interferograms produced by data pairs characterized by a small orbital separation (baseline) in order to limit the spatial decorrelation phenomena. The application of the singular value decomposition method allows us to easily "link" independent SAR acquisition datasets, separated by large baselines, thus increasing the observation temporal sampling rate. The availability of both spatial and temporal information in the processed data is used to identify and filter out atmospheric phase artifacts. We present results obtained on the data acquired from 1992 to 2000 by the European Remote Sensing satellites and relative to the Campi Flegrei caldera and to the city of Naples, Italy, that demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to follow the dynamics of the detected deformations.},

  abstract = {As a future satellite mission concept, active microwave sensors have the potential to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) with advantages including finer spatial resolution and improved capabilities in deeper snowpack and forest-covered 15 areas as compared to existing missions (e.g., passive microwave sensors). In mountainous regions, however, the potential utility of spaceborne active microwave sensors for SWE retrievals particularly under deep snow and forest cover has not been evaluated yet. In this study, we develop an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) that includes the characterization of expected error levels of the active microwave-based volume-scattering SWE retrievals and realistic orbital configurations over a western Colorado domain. We found that active microwave sensors can improve a root mean 20 square error (RMSE) of SWE by about 20\% in the mountainous environment if the active microwave signals with a mature retrieval algorithm can estimate SWE up to 600 mm of deep SWE and up to 40\% of tree cover fraction (TCF). Results also demonstrated that the potential SWE retrievals have larger improvements in tundra (43\%) snow class, followed by boreal forest (22\%) and montane forest (17\%). Even though active microwave sensors are known to be limited by liquid water in the snowpack, they still reduced errors by up to 6-16\% of domain-average SWE in the melting period, suggesting that the 25 SWE retrievals can add value to meltwater estimations and hydrological applications. Overall, this work provides a quantitative benchmark of the utility of a potential snow mission concept in a mountainous domain, helping prioritize future algorithm development and field validation activities.},

  abstract = {Snow is a fundamental component of global and regional water budgets, particularly in mountainous areas and regions downstream that rely on snowmelt for water resources. Land surface models (LSMs) are commonly used to develop spatially distributed estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff. However, LSMs are limited by uncertainties in model physics and parameters, among other factors. In this study, we describe the use of model calibration tools to improve snow simulations within the Noah-MP LSM as the first step in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE). Noah-MP is calibrated against the University of Arizona (UA) SWE product over a western Colorado domain. With spatially varying calibrated parameters, we run calibrated and default Noah-MP simulations for water years 2010\textendash 20. By evaluating both simulations against the UA dataset, we show that calibration decreases domain averaged temporal RMSE and bias for snow depth from 0.15 to 0.13 m and from 20.036 to 20.0023 m, respectively, and improves the timing of snow ablation. Increased snow simulation performance also improves estimates of model-simulated runoff in four of six study basins, though only one has statistically significant improvement. Spatially distributed Noah-MP snow parameters perform better than default uniform values. We demonstrate that calibrating variables related to snow albedo calculations and rain\textendash snow partitioning, among other processes, is a necessary step for creating a nature run that reasonably approximates true snow conditions for the OSSEs. Additionally, the inclusion of a snowfall scaling term can address biases in precipitation from meteorological forcing datasets, further improving the utility of LSMs for generating reliable spatiotemporal estimates of snow.},

Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used.},

  abstract = {Because of its location, Canada is particularly affected by snow processes and their impact on the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Yet, snow mass observations that are ongoing, global, frequent (1\textendash 5 days), and at high enough spatial resolution (kilometer scale) for assimilation within operational prediction systems are presently not available. Recently, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) partnered with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to initiate a radar-focused snow mission concept study to define spaceborne technological solutions to this observational gap. In this context, an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) was performed to determine the impact of sensor configuration, snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval performance, and snow wet/dry state on snow analyses from the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS). The synthetic experiment shows that snow analyses are strongly sensitive to revisit frequency since more frequent assimilation leads to a more constrained land surface model. The greatest reduction in spatial (temporal) bias is from a 1-day revisit frequency with a 91\% (93\%) improvement. Temporal standard deviation of the error (STDE) is mostly reduced by a greater retrieval accuracy with a 65\% improvement, while a 1-day revisit reduces the temporal STDE by 66\%. The inability to detect SWE under wet snow conditions is particularly impactful during the spring meltdown, with an increase in spatial RMSE of up to 50 mm. Wet snow does not affect the domain-wide annual maximum SWE nor the timing of end-of-season snowmelt timing in this case, indicating that radar measurements, although uncertain during melting events, are very useful in adding skill to snow analyses.},

  abstract = {As the Earth warms, the spatial and temporal response of seasonal snow remains uncertain. The global snow science community estimates snow cover and mass with information from land surface models, numerical weather prediction, satellite observations, surface measurements, and combinations thereof. Accurate estimation of snow at the spatial and temporal scales over which snow varies has historically been challenged by the complexity of land cover and terrain and the large global extent of snow-covered regions. Like many Earth science disciplines, snow science is in an era of rapid advances as remote sensing products and models continue to gain granularity and physical fidelity. Despite clear progress, the snow science community continues to face challenges related to the accuracy of seasonal snow estimation. Namely, advances in snow modeling remain limited by uncertainties in modeling parameterization schemes and input forcings, and advances in remote sensing techniques remain limited by temporal, spatial, and technical constraints on the variables that can be observed. Accurate monitoring and modeling of snow improves our ability to assess Earth system conditions, trends, and future projections while serving highly valued global interests in water supply and weather forecasts. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand and improve the errors and uncertainties associated with estimates of snow. A potential method to overcome model and observational shortcomings is data assimilation, which leverages the information content in both observations and models while minimizing their limitations due to uncertainty. This article proposes data assimilation as a way to reduce uncertainties in the characterization of seasonal snow changes and reviews current modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation techniques applied to the estimation of seasonal snow. Finally, remaining challenges for seasonal snow estimation are discussed.},

Traditional methods to estimate precipitation include in-situ gauges, doppler weather radars, satellite radars and radiometers, numerical modeling and reanalysis products. Each of these methods is unable to capture complex orographic precipitation. Here, we propose a novel approach to characterize orographic snowfall over mountain regions. We use a particle batch smoother to leverage satellite information from Sentinel-1 derived snow depth observations and to correct various gridded precipitation products. This novel approach is tested using a simple snow model for an alpine basin located in Trentino Alto Adige, Italy. We quantify the precipitation biases across the basin and found that the assimilation method (i) corrects for snowfall biases and uncertainties, (ii) leads to cumulative snowfall elevation gradients that are consistent across precipitation products, and (iii) results in overall improved basin-wide snow variables (snow depth and snow cover area) and basin streamflow.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100\,m, 500\,m, and 1\,km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017\textendash 2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500\,m and 1\,km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20\,\%\textendash 30\,\% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3\,m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100\,m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) based on remote sensing have been elusive, particularly in mountain areas. However, there now appears to be some potential for direct satellite-based SWE observations along ground tracks that only cover a portion of a spatial domain (e.g., watershed). Fortunately, spatiotemporally continuous meteorological and surface variables could be leveraged to infer SWE in the gaps between satellite ground tracks. Here, we evaluate statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches to performing track-to-area (TTA) transformations of SWE observations in California's upper Tuolumne River watershed using synthetic data. The synthetic SWE measurements are designed to mimic a potential future P-band Signals of Opportunity (P-SoOP) satellite mission with a (along-track) spatial resolution of about 500\,m. We construct relationships between multiple meteorological and surface variables and synthetic SWE observations along observation tracks, and we then extend these relationships to unobserved areas between ground tracks to estimate SWE over the entire watershed. Domain-wide, SWE inferred on 1~April using two synthetic satellite tracks ({$\sim$}4.5\,\% basin coverage) led to percent errors of basin-averaged SWE (PEBAS) of 24.5\,\%, 4.5\,\% and 6.3\,\% in an extremely dry water year (WY2015), a normal water year (WY2008) and an extraordinarily wet water year (WY2017), respectively. Assuming a 10\,d overpass interval, percent errors of basin-averaged SWE during both snow accumulation and snowmelt seasons were mostly less than 10\,\%. We employ a feature sensitivity analysis to overcome the black-box nature of ML methods and increase the explainability of the ML results. Our feature sensitivity analysis shows that precipitation is the dominant variable controlling the TTA SWE estimation, followed by net long-wave radiation (NetLong). We find that a modest increase in the accuracy of SWE estimation occurs when more than two ground tracks are leveraged. The accuracy of 1~April SWE estimation is only modestly improved for track repeats more often than about 15\,d.},

Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/ SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.},

  abstract = {A proof-of-concept experiment was carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) using P-band signals of opportunity. The fundamental observation is the change in the phase of the reflected waveforms as related to the change in SWE. Through theoretical modeling it was found that the change in SWE was approximately linearly dependent on the change in phase. This was verified by retrieving SWE data collected and processed from a tower-based experiment at Fraser, CO, USA. A linear regression was performed on measured phase and in situ SWE. The correlation was found to be 0.94 and root mean square deviation was found to be 7.5 mm.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 \texttimes{} 106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate ({$\sim$} -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.},

  abstract = {The spaceborne aperture radar (SAR) technique based on a combination of P-band signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry with a sparse array of receivers at low earth orbits (LEOs) and transmit signals from the United States Navy's Mobile User Objective System operating on a geosynchronous altitude has been analyzed. The design focuses on the forward-looking geometry near the specular direction, which allows a high surface reflectivity, in order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a moderate receiving antenna gain. The sparse array is utilized to sharpen the across-track resolution and reduce the iso-range ambiguity. The formulation for match filtering and illustrations of point target response are presented. This work shows that an array of five to seven receivers is able to achieve an across-track resolution of about 200 m in the outer portion of swath and about 1 km in the center part of swath. The along-track resolution can reach 10 m or better due to the feasibility of a long dwell time for Doppler filtering. We find that the sparse array allows the reduction of the iso-range ambiguity to a level of lower than 5\% for a major portion of swath, 70\% or greater depending on the number of receivers and spacing. We have completed an SNR formulation, which can consistently account for both coherent and incoherent scattering regardless the spatial resolution. An analysis of SNR based on the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering has been performed. We find that it is possible to obtain a swath width of 100 km with an SNR of 5 dB or better for a constellation of seven satellites with a receiving antenna directivity of 15 dBi at a LEO altitude of 675 km for a wide range of surface roughness. Our study suggests the promise of the SoOpSAR concept for high-resolution remote sensing of land surfaces.},

  abstract = {We present a review of small baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis with a new processing workflow and software implemented in Python, named MintPy (https://github.com/insarlab/MintPy). The time series analysis is formulated as a weighted least squares inversion. The inversion is unbiased for a fully connected network of interferograms without multiple subsets, such as provided by modern SAR satellites with small orbital tube and short revisit time. In the routine workflow, we first invert the interferogram stack for the raw phase time-series, then correct for the deterministic phase components: the tropospheric delay (using global atmospheric models or the delay-elevation ratio), the topographic residual and/or phase ramp, to obtain the noise-reduced displacement time-series. Next, we estimate the average velocity excluding noisy SAR acquisitions, which are identified using an outlier detection method based on the root mean square of the residual phase. The routine workflow includes three new methods to correct or exclude phase-unwrapping errors for two-dimensional algorithms: (i) the bridging method connecting reliable regions with minimum spanning tree bridges (particularly suitable for islands), (ii) the phase closure method exploiting the conservativeness of the integer ambiguity of interferogram triplets (well suited for highly redundant networks), and (iii) coherence-based network modification to identify and exclude interferograms with remaining coherent phase-unwrapping errors. We apply the routine workflow to the Gal\'apagos volcanoes using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-1 data, assess the qualities of the essential steps in the workflow and compare the results with independent GPS measurements. We discuss the advantages and limitations of temporal coherence as a reliability measure, evaluate the impact of network redundancy on the precision and reliability of the InSAR measurements and its practical implication for interferometric pairs selection. A comparison with another open-source time series analysis software demonstrates the superior performance of the approach implemented in MintPy in challenging scenarios.},
