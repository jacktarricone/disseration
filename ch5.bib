  abstract = {Abstract                            Water stored in mountain snowpacks (i.e., snow water equivalent, SWE) represents an important but poorly characterized component of the terrestrial water cycle. The Western United States snow reanalysis (WUS\textendash SR) dataset is novel in its combination of spatial resolution (\textasciitilde 500\,m), spatial extent (31\textdegree\textendash 49\textdegree{} N; 102\textdegree\textendash 125\textdegree{} W), and temporal continuity (daily over 1985\textendash 2021). WUS\textendash SR is generated using a Bayesian framework with model-based snow estimates updated through the assimilation of cloud-free Landsat fractional snow-covered area observations. Over the WUS, the peak SWE verification with independent               in situ               measurements show correlation coefficient, mean difference (MD), and root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.77, -0.15\,m, and 0.28\,m, respectively. The effects of forest cover and Landsat image availability on peak SWE are assessed. WUS\textendash SR peak SWE is well correlated (ranging from 0.75 to 0.91) against independent lidar-derived SWE taken near April 1               st               , with MD {$<$}0.15\,m and RMSD {$<$}0.38\,m. The dataset is useful for characterizing WUS mountain snow storage, and ultimately for improving snow-derived water resources management.},
