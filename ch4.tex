Measuring the spatial and temporal distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth in the world’s mountains is the preeminent unsolved challenge facing snow hydrology \citep{dozierEstimatingSpatialDistribution2016}. Despite the critical importance of these measurements, no single spaceborne sensor will be able to monitor SWE from all snow classes \citep{sturmSeasonalSnowCover1995, sturmRevisitingGlobalSeasonal2021} globally at scales relevant to basin-scale water resource management \citep{lettenmaierInroadsRemoteSensing2015}. Thus, breakthroughs in spaceborne SWE monitoring will require a multisensor approach \citep{durandAchievingBreakthroughsGlobal2021}, also known as sensor fusion, with the combination of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as a prime candidate. SAR will be at the forefront of future advancements in satellite remote sensing of SWE and snow depth, with multiple snow-focused SAR missions under development from NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) \citep{tsangReviewArticleGlobal2022, yuehSatelliteSyntheticAperture2021, garnaudQuantifyingSnowMass2019}. In addition, there are planned launches of L-band SARs such as the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) in 2024 and the European Space Agencies (ESA) Radar Observation System for Europe in L-band (ROSE-L) near the end of the decade. L-band interferometric SAR (InSAR) shows promise for SWE change monitoring \citep{tarriconeEstimatingSnowAccumulation2023a, marshallLBandInSARDepth2021, naglerAirborneExperimentInsar2022}. Moreover, the launch of Sentinel-1C in 2023 reestablishes the two-satellite constellation and continues global C-band coverage (***rework this sentence***). 

%%%%: topic: reviewing SAR-based dry snow cover algorithms and showing they're not sufficient
Snowpack that is important for human water resources mainly exists in complex mid-latitude mountain environments (cite). In the WUS, snow covered area (SCA) ranges between a median value of $\sim$3,000 km$^{2}$ at its summer minimum and $\sim$10$^{6}$ km$^{2}$ during the winter maximum \citep{rittgerSnowToday2022} (more here, possibly percentage of land area). Existing SAR-based techniques do not possess the capability to accurately delineate dry snow cover on their own \citep{tsaiRemoteSensingSnow2019}. There have been experimental attempts to use SAR at various frequencies and polarizations to detect dry (add varade) snow \citep{rottThematicStudiesAlpine1994, shiMappingSeasonalSnow1997}. Many studies employed a complex polarimetric decomposition (sen1 dual pol) (cite) or machine learning techniques (cite). While there has been progress in this area, none of these methods are mature enough for operational snow cover mapping. \par

%%%% topic: a review of current operational snow cover products
Contrarily, methods for passive microwave (PM), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) snow cover mapping are mature and routinely practiced \citep{dozierMultispectralHyperspectralRemote2004,saberiReviewSnowWater2020}. PM instruments produce data on the spatial scale of tens of kilometers, are only effective in dry snowpacks $<$ 1 m, and therefore are not suitable for mountain watershed snowpack applications (more citations here). Optical and NIR snow mapping methods date back to the earliest earth-observing satellites \citep{rangoSatellitePotentialsSnowcover1976a}. Numerous studies have utilized multi-spectral data in mountain environments from the Landsat 5-9 \citep{dozierSpectralSignatureAlpine1989} (more) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) \citep{painterRetrievalSubpixelSnowcovered2003, painterRetrievalSubpixelSnow2009, rittgerAssessmentMethodsMapping2013} (***rework, good start***). 

These optical methods are the basis for various snow cover products. In the western US (WUS), there is a fractional snow covered area (fSCA) product from Landsat 8/9 \citep{selkowitzUSGSLandsatSnow2017}, and a Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) \citep{dozierSpectralSignatureAlpine1989, hallDevelopmentMethodsMapping1995} product from the MODIS \citep{hallMODISSnowcoverProducts2002} and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) \citep{justiceLandCryosphereProducts2013}. For Europe and various other parts of the world, Gascoin et al. \citep{gascoinTheiaSnowCollection2019a} created the Theia Snow collection, which uses Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 A/B independently to map binary snow presence.

%%%% topic: lidar from space won't work
Previous research has explored various types of multisensor approaches for different snow monitoring applications. The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) \citep{painterAirborneSnowObservatory2016} leverages suborbital lidar altimetry \citep{deemsLidarMeasurementSnow2013}, hyperspectral imaging \citep{nolinMappingAlpineSnow1993}, and spatially distributed snow density modeling \citep{marksSpatiallyDistributedEnergy1999,hedrickDirectInsertionNASA2018a,meyerOperationalWaterForecast2023a} to estimate basin-scale SWE at high resolutions (1--50 m). While this technique is now operational, there is no clear pathway to space for spatially distributed lidar retrievals. Currently, only linear transects from satellites such as NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) \citep{abdalatiICESat2LaserAltimetry2010} and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) \citep{dubayahGlobalEcosystemDynamics2020} are possible. Moreover, even the sparse measurements from the aforementioned spaceborne lidars show uncertainties of 1--2 m for snow depth retrievals in complex terrain \citep{enderlinUncertaintyICESat2ATL062022, deschamps-bergerEvaluationSnowDepth2022}. 

%%%% topic: optical fusion
*** Recently, NASA released the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data product which fuses the two sensors to produce lower temporal resolution surface reflectance data.
Rittger et al. \citep{rittgerMultisensorFusionUsing2021} combined Landsat and MODIS with machine learning to achieve a spatiotemporally complete 30 m fSCA dataset over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA. ****

%%%% topic: SAR/optical for SWE or depth fusion products
Few studies have employed optical and SAR data synergistically for snow depth and SWE retrievals. \cite{lievensSnowDepthVariability2019,lievensSentinel1SnowDepth2022} developed a Sentinel-1 C-band snow depth retrieval algorithm using the co-polarized and cross-polarized backscatter ratio. They identified snow cover using 1 km$^{2}$ binary snow cover information from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) \citep{u.s.nationalicecenterIMSDailyNorthern2008, ramsayInteractiveMultisensorSnow1998, helfrichEnhancementsForthcomingDevelopments2007}, and fractional forest cover using the 1 km$^{2}$ global consensus land cover dataset \citep{tuanmuGlobal1kmConsensus2014}, at both European and Northern Hemispherical scales. These new methods are promising, especially as the physical mechanisms governing the C-band retrievals continue to emerge \citep{zhuModelingScatteringDense2023}. \cite{tarriconeEstimatingSnowAccumulation2023a} utilized Landsat fSCA information with UAVSAR \citep{hensleyUAVSARInstrumentDescription2008} L-band InSAR data to estimate both snow ablation and accumulation in the Jemez Mountains, NM. They note the multifaceted importance of a optical-radar multisensor approach for snow cover delineation and SAR atmospheric correction. 

These past studies have subjectively selected various products (e.g., fSCA, binary, NSDI), spatial resolutions ($\sim$ 1--1000 m), and temporal resolutions (1--16 d) without any systematic investigation of the uncertainties associated with each. Our study aims to better understand the variability between common snow cover data products and how that uncertainty propagates into SAR-based SWE retrieval techniques. To do this, we analyze L-band InSAR SWE changes estimates from UAVSAR collected by the NASA SnowEx 2020 \cite{marshallNASASnowEx20202019} campaign in the Upper San Joaquin (USJ) River basin in Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA. NISAR's upcoming launch in early 2024 makes the InSAR approach the most ***time sensitive*** of the SWE measurement techniques.

% -Despite the previously stated importance of a multisensor snow depth and SWE monitoring approach, few works have explored the best combination of sensors.
% - Herein, we will refer to our methodology as a ``multisensor" approach. Previous works (karl, add others) have used the term ``sensor fusion", which can be thought of as the same thing. Neither of these terms has concrete definitions, and therefore our word choice is subjective.

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-1}{\subsection{UAVSAR}\label{ch4-methods-1}}

UAVSAR flights occurred on 26 February 2020 and 11 March 2011 2020 and covered an area of $\sim$1600 km$^{2}$. These data were processed by the UAVSAR team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to create a single 14 d baseline 6 m ground projected InSAR pair. These products include unwrapped phase (herein referred to as phase), coherence, and incidence angle. Table \ref{table:uavsar_proc} shows the information on the radar (top) and the specific processing parameters (bottom). To better replicate the NISAR returns, we resampled the 6~m UAVSAR data to 80~m, which is the resolution NISAR data products will be produced. To do this, we used Sentinel-1 Geocoded Unwrapped Interferograms (S1 GUNW), produced in the same data format and spatial resolution (80 m) that NISAR data will be. These data are generated by NASA's Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) \citep{bekaertDevelopmentDisseminationStandardized2019,buzzangaSustainedMonitoringSubsidence2020} project and accessed via the Alaska Satellite Facility Distributed Active Archive Center (ASF DAAC).

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-2}{\subsection{Snow cover data}\label{ch4-methods-2}}

Optical snow cover information is traditionally derived using either the normalized snow difference index (NDSI) \citep{dozierSpectralSignatureAlpine1989} or spectral-mixture analysis \citep{rosenthalAutomatedMappingMontane1996,nolinMappingAlpineSnow1993}. While we provided a brief description of the methods below, the reader is referred to the aforementioned publications and \cite{stillingerLandsatMODISVIIRS2023} for a detailed description of the two techniques.

Snow is highly reflective in the visible (VIS) wavelengths ($\sim$0.4--0.7~$\mu$m) while demonstrating strong absorption characteristics in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) ($\sim$1--4~$\mu$m) spectrum. This relationship is leveraged by the NSDI equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ndsi}
NDSI = \frac{VIS - SWIR}{VIS + SWIR}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the NDSI values range from $-$1 to $+$1. The exact band and wavelength will vary by remote sensing platform.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) is a hemispherical scale binary 1 km snow cover product originally created to help with numerical weather prediction 
\citep{ramsayInteractiveMultisensorSnow1998, helfrichEnhancementsForthcomingDevelopments2007}. The input data comes a variety of platforms, including but not limited to: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) next generation of geostationary satellites (GOES) constellation \citep{menzelIntroducingGOESIFirst1994}, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) \citep{cracknellAdvancedVeryHigh1997}, MODIS \citep{salomonsonMODISAdvancedFacility1989}, and the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) \citep{barrettandrewNationalOperationalHydrologic2003}.

***The MODIS Snow-Covered Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) \citep{painterRetrievalSubpixelSnow2009} is a spectral-mixing model that uses various end-members (e.g. rock, soil, snow, clouds, etc.) to produce estimates of fSCA, fractional vegetation (fVEG), snow grain size, and albedo.

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-5}{\subsubsection{MODIS}\label{ch4-methods-5}}

The MODIS cloud-gap-filled (CGF) snow cover product \citep{hallEvaluationMODISVIIRS2019} provides daily NSDI values at 500 m spatial resolution from the Terra (MOD10A1F) and Aqua (MYD10A1F) satellites. These data account for cloud cover by excluded pixels  flagged as clouds and refilling them with NDSI from the last cloud free day. This process only goes on for **eight** days of cloud cover until the pixel is marked as NA. NDSI can be used to directly estimate fSCA \citep{salomonsonEstimatingFractionalSnow2004, salomonsonDevelopmentAquaMODIS2006,stillingerLandsatMODISVIIRS2023}. We estimated MODIS fSCA using the Eq. \ref{eq:fsca}:

\begin{equation}
\text{fSCA} = 0.01 + (1.45 \times NDSI)
\label{eq:fsca}
\end{equation}


\hypertarget{ch4-methods-6}{\subsubsection{VIIRS}\label{ch4-methods-6}}

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar Partnership (S-NPP) produces a daily CGF NDSI product (VNP10A1F) at 375 m spatial resolution \citep{hallEvaluationMODISVIIRS2019}. These data are generated and gap filled using the same methods as the MODIS CFG data outlined in Section \ref{ch4-methods-5}. We converted the VIIRS NSDI values to fCSA using Eq. \ref{eq:fsca}.


\hypertarget{ch4-methods-7}{\subsubsection{FLM}\label{ch4-methods-7}}

***The fused Landsat-MODIS (FLM) fSCA product created by \cite{rittgerMultisensorFusionUsing2021} is spatiotemporally continuous 30 m over the Sierra Nevada, CA. The goal of their data fusion methods was to create a product with the high spatial resolution of Landsat (30 m) with the high temporal resolution of MODIS (1 d), leveraging the strengths of both sensors. These data were created using a combination of 170 Landsat scenes, daily MOD09GA Collection 6 in a sinusoidal projection at 463 m, physiographic information, spectral mixture algorithms, and random forest algorithm. 

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-8}{\subsubsection{Landsat fSCA}\label{ch4-methods-8}}

Landsat~8 fSCA \citep{u.s.geologicalsurveyearthresourcesobservationandsciencecenterCollection1LandsatLevel32018} data are generated using a spectral unmixing analysis based on the MODSCAG algorithm developed for MODIS (Painter et al., 2009). The data processing workflow includes water masking, cloud masking, and canopy cover corrections \citep{selkowitzUSGSLandsatSnow2017, stillingerLandsatMODISVIIRS2023}. As of 2021 (**check this), the data products include both viewable fSCA and total ground fSCA. To estimate total fSCA in areas with canopy cover, a moving window analysis algorithm is employed, and it selects. The data used in this study is from 4~March 2020 (Fig.~4.2e).

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-1}{\subsection{Calculating InSAR $\Delta$SWE}\label{ch4-methods-1}}


First, the UAVSAR phase data were masked with each of the six fSCA products. A threshold of $>$\,15\,\% fSCA was set for a pixel to be considered snow covered. We then employ the InSAR $\Delta$SWE methodology described in Sec.~\ref{ch3-methods-1}. The SnowEx in situ data collection within the Sierra flight line did not include a permittivity measurement. Therefore, permittivity was estimated using the density to permittivity equation from \cite{guneriussenInSAREstimationChanges2001}:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\mathrm{s} = 1 + 1.6 * \rho_\mathrm{s} + 1.8 * \rho_\mathrm{s}^3
\label{eq:dens_to_perm}
\end{equation}


\noindent Using Eq.~\ref{eq:insar_dswe}, pixel-wise $\Delta$SWE values were calculated with inputs of $\lambda$ (23.84\,cm), $\rho_\mathrm{s}$ of 370 kg\,m$^{-3}$, $\epsilon_\mathrm{s}$ of 1.68, and $\theta$. 

To find the known change point to tether the initially relative InSAR $\Delta$SWE values, we used three snow pillows (vlc, mhp, ubc, wwc) from CADWR. The SnowEx $\Delta$SWE pit data could not be directly utilized because the phase values over the Mammoth CUES pit did not unwrap properly, resulting in the absence of any data. Additionally, the Panorama Dome pit was not dug during the study period. To account for uncertainties within the snow pillow geolocation, we extracted the UAVSAR pixel that the snow pillow was within and the eight surrounding pixels. We then took a spatial average of the relative InSAR $\Delta$SWE and the three pillows $\Delta$SWE values and subtracted them to obtain an absolute change. We report our data in units of cubic hectometers (dam$^{3}$). A cubic hectometer is equal to 10$^{6}$ m$^{3}$, 10$^{-3}$ km$^{3}$, or $\sim$810 acre-feet.

\hypertarget{ch4-methods-2}{\subsection{Quantifying $\Delta$SWE Variability}\label{ch4-methods-1}}


To understand how the various fSCA products impacted the scene wide $\Delta$SWE estimates, we performed a summing moving window analysis of the six UAVSAR-derived $\Delta$SWE datasets. The variability in the $\Delta$SWE data products solely comes from which pixels are considered snow covered and which are not. Therefore, a pixel-wise analysis and not an apt solution, as this would be comparing pixel with values to NA values.

For the analysis, the $\Delta$SWE data were separated loss and gains to prevent the cancellation of patterns caused by opposite signs within an area. The pixel-wise SWE changes were then summed using a 41 $\times$ 41 pixel moving window. Next, the standard deviation (SD) of the six moving window summed products was calculated. The relatively large window size was selected to minimize the of NA (not available) pixels in the SD calculation, where only datasets with 41-pixel squared areas of no snow will produced NA values. Summed pixels with NA values were not included in the SD calculations. This is important for the IMS data as the northeast corner has a large continuous swath of NA values.

\hypertarget{ch4-results}{\subsection{$\Delta$SWE Estimates}\label{ch4-results}}

The spatially distributed UAVSAR $\Delta$SWE estimates for each of the six fSCA products are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:uavsar_dswe}. The black areas represent pixels lost in the unwrapping process (Fig. \ref{fig:uavsar_cor_inc_phase_plot}b), and are static throughout Fig.~\ref{fig:uavsar_dswe}a--e. The gray area represents pixels not considered snow covered by the given fSCA product, and these areas spatially variable in the six scenes. Overall, the six scenes show a mean net SWE of $-$14,600~dam$^{3}$, with a mean gain of $-$3,100~dm$^{3}$ and loss of $-$17,800~dam$^{3}$ (Table~\ref{tab:dswe_stats}, \ref{fig:dswe_bar_graph}). These values are consistent with in situ snow pillow data in this area, as there was a prolonged dry spell during 26 February to March 4 time span (***add appendix figure here).

When disaggregated to SWE gains and losses, MODIS shows the greatest SWE gain of 3,800~dam$^{3}$. Landsat estimated the least (2,100~dam$^{3}$) with IMS showing a similar low value of 2,300~dam$^{3}$. The SWE gain values from MODSCAG, VIIRS, and FLM were quite similar to MODIS, with no product differing more than 400~dam$^{3}$.
MODIS also produced the greatest SWE loss ($-$19,100~dam$^{3}$), with Landsat again providing a low value of $-$12,900~dam$^{3}$. IMS, MODSCAG, VIIRS, and FLM again provided consistent estimates, with the standard deviation of these five data products SWE loss being only 350~dam$^{3}$. Landsat's SWE loss of $-$12,900~dam$^{3}$ is $-$5,800~dam$^{3}$ greater compared to the five other data products mean SWE loss of $-$18,700~dam$^{3}$. These differences propagate into the net $\Delta$SWE values, where the five products other than Landsat provided highly consistent values, with a mean net $\Delta$SWE $-$15,400~$\pm$~300~dam$^{3}$. We report a 35.1~\% difference between the aforementioned mean value and Landsat.

\hypertarget{ch4-results}{\subsection{$\Delta$SWE Variability}\label{ch4-results}}

Fig.~\ref{fig:dswe_moving_window} shows the moving window sums of the $\Delta$SWE gains and losses. The majority of the SWE gains are recorded in the northeast and southeast portions of the swatch. The SWE gain spatial patterns between the datasets are similar expect for the northeast corner of the IMS data. This area is shown as no snow while while MODSCAG, MODIS, VIIRS, and FLM display SWE gains on the order of 100--150~dam$^{3}$. Landsat shows SWE gain in this area as well, but with a lesser magnitude of $\sim$50~dam$^{3}$. All datasets other than Landsat show consistent spatial patterns and SWE loss magnitudes. Landsat's patterns are similar, yet less extensive. This is driven by the fSCA data not being spatiotemporally continuous, hence the $\Delta$SWE sums being of a lesser magnitude. The large are of NA values in the IMS data is not of concern as this area was considered SWE gain by the data. In the center left of the swath, all datasets show a lower elevation snow free area except for IMS. However, most of the $\Delta$SWE values in that area and relatively small, therefore not significantly biasing the results.

The 41 $\times$ 41 moving window pixel-wise SD of SWE gains and losses are compared to canopy cover percentage in Fig.~\ref{fig:dswe_standard_deviation}. The area with the greatest SD of 30--50~dam$^{3}$ was in the northeast corner of swath. The sharp transition from red to green is driven by the NA values in the IMS data. Large SWE loss variability was centered around lower elevation area in the center of the scene. This $\Delta$SWE SD was then comparied to canopy over percent in the boxplots in Fig.~\ref{fig:dswe_boxplots}

-Our variability analysis was an imperfect comparison between the fix data products. While we used a 55$\times$55 moving window, the IMS data had a large continuous snow free area in the northeast corner. These pixels were then omitted from the standard deviation analysis, propagating uncertainty in the calculation as one dataset was no used.
