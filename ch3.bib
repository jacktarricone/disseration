  abstract = {Snow albedo is a dominant control on snowmelt in many parts of the world. An empirical albedo decay equation, developed over 60 years ago, is still used in snowmelt models. Several empirical snow albedo models developed since show wide spread in results. Remotely sensed snow albedos have been used in a few studies, but validations are scarce because of the difficulty in making accurate in situ measurements. Reconstruction of snow water equivalent (SWE), where the snowpack is built in reverse, is especially sensitive to albedo. We present two new contributions: (1) an updated albedo model where grain size and light absorbing particle content are solved for simultaneously and (2) multiyear comparisons of remotely sensed and in situ albedo measurements from three high-altitude sites in the western United States. Our remotely sensed albedos show 4 to 6\% RMSE and negligible bias. In comparison, empirical albedo decay models, which require extensive in situ measurements, show RMSE values of 7 to 17\% with biases of -6 to -14\%. We examine the sensitivity of SWE reconstructions to albedo error at two sites. With no simulated error in albedo, reconstructed SWE had MAE values of 7 to 13\% and 5\textendash 6\% bias. The accuracy actually improved with some simulated added error, likely because of a fundamental bias in the reconstruction approach. Conversely, the best age-based decay model showed an 18\textendash 20\% MAE and bias in reconstructed SWE. We conclude that remotely sensed albedos where available are superior to age-based approaches in all aspects except simplicity.},

  abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an active sensor transmitting pulses of polarized electromagnetic waves and receiving the backscattered radiation. SAR sensors at different wavelengths and with different polarimetric capabilities are being used in remote sensing of the earth. The value of an analysis of backscattered energy alone is limited due to ambiguities in the possible ecological factor configurations causing the signal. From two SAR images taken from similar viewing positions with a short time-lag, interference between the two waves can be observed. By subtracting the two phases of the signals, it is feasible to eliminate the random contribution of the scatterers to the phase. The interferometric correlation and the interferometric phase contain additional information on the three-dimensional structure of the scattering elements in the imaged area. A brief review of SAR sensors is given, followed by an outline of the physical foundations of SAR interferometry and the practical data-processing steps involved. An overview of applications of InSAR to forest mapping and monitoring is given, covering tree-bole volume and biomass, forest types and land cover, fire scars, forest thermal state and forest canopy height.},

Techniques are developed for identifying snow cover and for differentiating between snow and cloud. Comparisons between snow data observed by satellites and snow data conventionally acquired indicate that, in almost all cases, snow can be distinguished from cloud on the bases of current cloud reports, pattern continuity, landmark identification, and texture. Snow cover can be mapped from Tiros or Essa resolution photography with an accuracy of approximately {$\pm$}20 miles, often providing a more detailed mapping than can be obtained from conventional station networks. Qualitative estimates of snow depth can also be obtained from satellite photography. In nonforested areas, reflectivity increases with snow depth, until an accumulation of about 4 to 6 inches is reached ; after that, the reflectivity remains unchanged. In forested areas, no discernible relationship between reflectivity and snow depth is observed.},

  abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, like other heavily engineered deltas throughout the world, has undergone substantial subsidence since the late 1800s when the natural estuary was leveed to form islands. Today, islands within the Delta have subsided to the point where most lie below mean sea level. Long-term sustainability of the Delta requires reversal of subsidence, but spatially comprehensive maps of subsidence have not been available to inform and monitor remediation. Reported here is the first spatially dense map of recent subsidence rates across the Delta, based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry and constrained by GNSS observations. The analysis uses a temporally dense and spatially overlapping set of data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) sensor in 2009\textendash 2015. On average, the Delta is subsiding by 9.2 {$\pm$} 4.4 mm/yr with high variability even at the sub-island scale, including peak subsidence of 160 {$\pm$} 4.4 mm/yr occurring just inland of the levee of the westernmost island and average subsidence of 11 mm/yr along the planned path of water conveyance tunnels through the Delta. The results are compared to local sea level rise (SLR), measured at a tidal gauge in San Francisco Bay, to show that subsidence is currently the dominant contributor to local relative sea level rise (RSLR) by nearly a factor of five. Based on recently measured and modeled acceleration of SLR, subsidence in the Delta is likely to dominate RSLR until the middle of the 21th century.},

  abstract = {Correcting for tropospheric delays is one of the largest challenges facing the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) community. Spatial and temporal variations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity create tropospheric signals in InSAR data, masking smaller surface displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. Correction methods using weather model data, GNSS and/or spectrometer data have been applied in the past, but are often limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the auxiliary data. Alternatively a correction can be estimated from the interferometric phase by assuming a linear or a power-law relationship between the phase and topography. Typically the challenge lies in separating deformation from tropospheric phase signals. In this study we performed a statistical comparison of the state-of-the-art tropospheric corrections estimated from the MERIS and MODIS spectrometers, a low and high spatial-resolution weather model (ERA-I and WRF), and both the conventional linear and new power-law empirical methods. Our test-regions include Southern Mexico, Italy, and El Hierro. We find spectrometers give the largest reduction in tropospheric signal, but are limited to cloud-free and daylight acquisitions. We find a \textasciitilde 10\textendash 20\% RMSE increase with increasing cloud cover consistent across methods. None of the other tropospheric correction methods consistently reduced tropospheric signals over different regions and times. We have released a new software package called TRAIN (Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise), which includes all these state-of-the-art correction methods. We recommend future developments should aim towards combining the different correction methods in an optimal manner.},

  abstract = {Radar instruments have been widely used to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is a promising approach for doing so from spaceborne platforms. Electromagnetic waves propagate through the snowpack at a velocity determined by its dielectric permittivity. Velocity estimates are a significant source of uncertainty in radar SWE retrievals, especially in wet snow. In dry snow, velocity can be calculated from relations between permittivity and snow density. However, wet snow velocity is a function of both snow density and liquid water content (LWC); the latter exhibits high spatiotemporal variability, there is no standard observation method, and it is not typically measured by automated stations. In this study, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR), probed snow depths, and measured in situ vertically-averaged density to estimate SWE and bulk LWC for seven survey dates at Cameron Pass, Colorado (\textasciitilde 3120 m) from April to June 2019. During this cooler than average season, median LWC for individual survey dates never exceeded 7 vol. \%. However, in June, LWC values greater than 10 vol. \% were observed in isolated areas where the ground and the base of the snowpack were saturated and therefore inhibited further meltwater output. LWC development was modulated by canopy cover and meltwater drainage was influenced by ground slope. We generated synthetic SWE retrievals that resemble the planned footprint of the NASA-ISRO L-band InSAR satellite (NISAR) from GPR using a dry snow density model. Synthetic SWE retrievals overestimated observed SWE by as much as 40\% during the melt season due to the presence of LWC. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering LWC variability in order to fully realize the potential of future spaceborne radar missions for measuring SWE.},

There are currently no methods to remotely sense SWE with accuracy over large lateral distances in the steep and often forested terrain of mountain basins. Previous studies have shown that measurements of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) velocity can provide accurate estimates of SWE in dry snow. Introduction of liquid water into the snowpack results in a three-phase system that cannot be accurately characterized with GPR velocity alone. We show that measuring the frequency-dependent GPR signal attenuation and velocity provides a direct estimate of the complex dielectric permittivity. Because the imaginary component is a function only of liquid water content, we can utilize both the real and imaginary components of the permittivity to estimate liquid water content, snow density, and SWE using existing empirical relationships that are valid in the pendular regime. We tested this new method at two field sites and found that the estimates were accurate to within 12\% of gravimetric methods in both a moist and a dry snowpack. GPR has the potential to provide SWE estimates across large lateral distances over a broad range of snow conditions.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the uncertainty of water-saturated sediment velocity and porosity estimates derived from surface-based, ground-penetrating radar reflection tomography, we conducted a controlled field experiment at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS). The BHRS is an experimental well field located near Boise, Idaho. The experimental data set consisted of 3-D multioffset radar acquired on an orthogonal 20 \texttimes{} 30 m surface grid that encompassed a set of 13 boreholes. Experimental control included (1) 1-D vertical velocity functions determined from traveltime inversion of vertical radar profiles (VRP) and (2) neutron porosity logs. We estimated the porosity distribution in the saturated zone using both the Topp and Complex Refractive Index Method (CRIM) equations and found the CRIM estimates in better agreement with the neutron logs. We found that when averaged over the length of the borehole, surface-derived velocity measurements were within 5\% of the VRP velocities and that the porosity differed from the neutron log by less than 0.05. The uncertainty, however, is scale dependent. We found that the standard deviation of differences between ground-penetrating-radar-derived and neutron-log-derived porosity values was as high as 0.06 at an averaging length of 0.25 m but decreased to less than 0.02 at length scale of 11 m. Additionally, we used the 3-D porosity distribution to identify a relatively high-porosity anomaly (i.e., local sedimentary body) within a lower-porosity unit and verified the presence of the anomaly using the neutron porosity logs. Since the reflection tomography approach requires only surface data, it can provide rapid assessment of bulk hydrologic properties, identify meter-scale anomalies of hydrologic significance, and may provide input for other higher-resolution measurement methods.},

Cutter types included a 500 cm3 aluminium tube, 200 and 100 cm3 stainless-steel box types, 200 cm3 stainless-steel wedge types and a 100 cm3 stainless-steel tube. Without accounting for variation due to weighing devices, the range of values for `accepted practice' determined in this study included variation within individual cutters of 0.8\textendash 6.2\%, variation between cutters of 3\textendash 12\%, variation between cutter means and layer means of 2\textendash 7\%, and under-sampling errors of 0\textendash 2\%. The results of a statistical analysis suggest that snow density measurements taken using various density cutters are significantly different from each other. Without adjustment for under-sampling, and given that the mean of all measurements is the accepted true value of the layer density, variation exclusively between cutter types provides `accepted practice' measurements that are within 11\% of the true density.},

  abstract = {NASA's 2017 SnowEx field campaign at Grand Mesa, CO, generated Airborne Laser Scans (ALS), Terrestrial Laser Scans (TLS), and snow-probe transects, which allowed for a comparison between snow depth measurement techniques. At six locations, comparisons between gridded ALS and TLS observations, at 1-m resolution, had a median snow depth difference of 5 cm, root-mean-square difference of 16 cm, mean-absolute difference of 10 cm, and 3-cm difference in standard deviation. ALS generally had greater but similar snow depth values to TLS, and results were not sensitive to the gridded cell size between 0.5 and 5 m. The greatest disagreements were where snow-off TLS scans had shrubs and high incidence angles, leading to deeper snow depths ({$>$}10 cm) from ALS than TLS. The low vegetation and oblique angles caused occlusion in the TLS data and thus produced higher snow-off bare Earth models relative to the ALS. Furthermore, in subcanopy areas where both ALS and TLS data existed, snow depth differences were comparable to differences in the open. Meanwhile, median values from 52 snow-probe transects and near-coincident ALS data had a mean difference of 6 cm, root-mean-square difference of 8 cm, mean-absolute difference of 7 cm, and a mean difference in the standard deviation of 1 cm. Snow depth probes had greater but similar snow depth values to ALS. Therefore, based on comparisons with TLS and snow depth probes, ALS captured snow depth magnitude with better than or equal agreement to what has been reported in previous studies and showed the ability to capture high-resolution spatial variability.},

  abstract = {TerraSAR-X, the first civil German synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, was successfully launched on June 15, 2007. After 4.5 days, the first processed image was obtained. The overall quality of the image was outstanding; however, suspicious features could be identified which showed precipitation-related signatures. These rain-cell signatures are thoroughly investigated, and the physical background of the related propagation effects is provided. In addition, rain-cell signatures from former missions like SIR-C/X and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission are provided for comparison. During the commissioning phase of TerraSAR-X, a total of 12 000 scenes were investigated for potential propagation effects, and about 100 scenes revealed atmospheric effects to a visible extent. Some of the particularly interesting events were selected and are discussed in greater detail. An interesting case of data acquisition over New York will be presented, which shows typical rain-cell signatures, and the SAR image will be compared with weather-radar data acquired nearly simultaneously (within the same minute). By comparing the images, it can be clearly seen that reflectivities in the weather-radar image of 50 dBZ may cause visible artifacts in SAR images. Furthermore, in this paper, we discuss the influence of the atmosphere (troposphere) on the external calibration of TerraSAR-X. By acquiring simultaneous weather-radar data over the test site and the SAR acquisition, it was possible to flag affected SAR images and to exclude them from the procedure to derive the absolute calibration constant. Thus, it was possible to decrease the 1 {$\sigma$} uncertainty of the absolute calibration factor by 0.15 dB.},

  abstract = {Snowpack properties vary dramatically over a wide range of spatial scales, from crystal microstructure to regional snow climates. The driving forces of wind, energy balance, and precipitation interact with topography and vegetation to dominate snow depth variability at horizontal scales from 1 to 1000 m. This study uses land surface elevation, vegetation surface elevation, and snow depth data measured using airborne lidar at three sites in north-central Colorado. Fractal dimensions are estimated from the slope of a logtransformed variogram and demonstrate scale-invariant, fractal behavior in the elevation, vegetation, and snow depth datasets. Snow depth and vegetation topography each show two distinct fractal distributions over different scale ranges (multifractal behavior), with short-range fractal dimensions near 2.5 and longrange fractal dimensions around 2.9 at all locations. These fractal ranges are separated by a scale break at 15\textendash 40 m, depending on the site, which indicates a process change at that scale. Terrain has a fractal distribution over nearly the entire range of scales available in the data. Directional differences in the fractal dimensions for each parameter are also present at multiple scales, and are related to the wind direction frequency distributions at each site. The results indicate that different sampling resolutions may yield different results and allow rescaling in specific scale ranges. Resolutions of 10 m and finer are consistently self-similar, as are resolutions greater than 30 m, though the coarser resolutions show nearly random distributions.},

In this study, we generate five new DEMs of the Mont-Blanc area from TanDEM-X interferometric pairs acquired in 2012/2013. We conducted a multitemporal analysis of the DEMs in comparison with two high-resolution DEMs obtained from Pl\'eiades stereo satellite images in 2012 and 2013. A vertical precision of 1-3 m of the radar DEMs is estimated over ice and snow free areas and slopes less than 40\textdegree. DEM-derived elevation changes are compared with outputs of the snowpack model Crocus and snow accumulation measurements. The results show that at altitudes below 2500-m a.s.l., the radar penetration is negligible in our study area. The DEM-derived elevation changes agree, within uncertainty, with the modeled and field snow height. At higher altitudes, the comparison between the radar and optical DEMs acquired only a few weeks apart allows estimating the interferometric bias of the X-band DEM in the dry snowpack. At 4000-m a.s.l, it reaches 4 m on average in October and February. A geodetic glacier mass balance calculated using the October radar DEM would be biased. For the least favorable case, the highly elevated Bossons glacier, the bias would correspond to 1.66-m w.e. This error is too large to derive significant annual mass balances, but similar to elevation or seasonality uncertainties if integrated over a 10-years period.},

The required combination of revisit time, spatial coverage, measurement resolution, and sensitivity to the mass of snow on the ground necessitates a new spaceborne observing concept. To address this observing gap, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the Canadian Space Agency, industrial partners at Airbus, and international scientific collaborators are developing a new dual frequency (Ku-band: 13.5 and 17.2 GHz), moderate resolution (250 m), wide swath ( 500 km) radar mission concept.

Separate algorithms derive SWE for open environments, deciduous, coniferous and sparse forest cover. A final SWE value represents the area-weighted average based on the proportional land cover within each pixel. In this study, 5 day averaged (pentad) passive-microwave-derived SWE imagery for the winter season (December\^February) of 1994/95 is compared to in situ data from central Canada in order to assess algorithm performance. Investigation of regions with varying proportional land cover within the four algorithm classes shows that retrieved SWE remains within \th 10\^20 mm of surface observations, independent of fractional within-pixel land cover. Following algorithm evaluation, ten winter seasons (1988/89 through 1997/98) of pentad central North American SWE imagery are subjected to a rotated principalcomponent analysis (PCA). Although there are no trends in total study-area SWE, the PCA results identify the interseasonal variability in the SWE accumulation and ablation centers of action through the SSM/I time series.},

  abstract = {Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful technology for observing the Earth surface, especially for mapping the Earth's topography and deformations. InSAR measurements are however often significantly affected by the atmosphere as the radar signals propagate through the atmosphere whose state varies both in space and in time. Great efforts have been made in recent years to better understand the properties of the atmospheric effects and to develop methods for mitigating the effects. This paper provides a systematic review of the work carried out in this area. The basic principles of atmospheric effects on repeat-pass InSAR are first introduced. The studies on the properties of the atmospheric effects, including the magnitudes of the effects determined in the various parts of the world, the spectra of the atmospheric effects, the isotropic properties and the statistical distributions of the effects, are then discussed. The various methods developed for mitigating the atmospheric effects are then reviewed, including the methods that are based on PSInSAR processing, the methods that are based on interferogram modeling, and those that are based on external data such as GPS observations, ground meteorological data, and satellite data including those from the MODIS and MERIS. Two examples that use MODIS and MERIS data respectively to calibrate atmospheric effects on InSAR are also given.},

  abstract = {The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T, varies significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific humidity. GAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art passive microwave remote sensing-based snow water equivalent (SWE) algorithms correct for factors believed to most significantly affect retrieved SWE bias and uncertainty. For example, a recently developed semi-empirical SWE retrieval algorithm accounts for systematic and random error caused by forest cover and snow morphology (crystal size \textemdash{} a function of location and time of year). However, we have found that climate and land surface complexities lead to significant systematic and random error uncertainties in remotely sensed SWE retrievals that are not included in current SWE estimation algorithms. Joint analysis of independent meteorological records, ground SWE measurements, remotely sensed SWE estimates, and land surface characteristics have provided a unique look at the error structure of these recently developed satellite SWE products. We considered satellite-derived SWE errors associated with the snow pack mass itself, the distance to significant open water bodies, liquid water in the snow pack and/or morphology change due to melt and refreeze, forest cover, snow class, and topographic factors such as large scale root mean square roughness and dominant aspect. Analysis of the nine-year Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) SWE data set was undertaken for Canada where many in-situ measurements are available. It was found that for SMMR pixels with 5 or more ground stations available, the remote sensing product was generally unbiased with a seasonal maximum 20 mm average root mean square error for SWE values less than 100 mm. For snow packs above 100 mm, the SWE estimate bias was linearly related to the snow pack mass and the root mean square error increased to around 150 mm. Both the distance to open water and average monthly mean air temperature were found to significantly influence the retrieved SWE product uncertainty. Apart from maritime snow class, which had the greatest snow class affect on root mean square error and bias, all other factors showed little relation to observed uncertainties. Eliminating the drop-in-the-bucket averaged gridded remote sensing SWE data within 200 km of open water bodies, for monthly mean temperatures greater than \`A2 -C, and for snow packs greater than 100 mm, has resulted in a remotely sensed SWE product that is useful for practical applications.},

We use a combination of noise filtering, snow/cloud discrimination, and interpolation and smoothing to produce our best estimate of the daily snow cover and albedo. We consider two modes: one is the ``predictive'' mode, whereby we estimate the snow-covered area and albedo on that day using only the data up to that day; the other is the ``retrospective'' mode, whereby we reconstruct the history of the snow properties for a previous period.},

We used dye tracers, geophysical methods, and hydrometric measurements to describe the snow properties that promote lateral flow, assess the relative velocities of lateral flow in snow and soil, and estimate volumes of downslope flow. Results demonstrate that rain and melt water can travel tens of metres downslope along layers within the snowpack or at the snowpack base within tens of hours. Lateral flow within the snowpack becomes less likely as the snowpack becomes saturated and stratigraphic boundaries are destroyed. Flow along the base can be prevalent in all snowpack conditions. The net result of lateral flow in snow can be the deposition of water on the soil surface in advanced downslope positions relative to its point of origin, or direct discharge to a stream. Although both melt and ROS events can redistribute water to downslope positions, ROS events produced the most significant volumes of downslope flow. Direct stream contributions through the snowpack during one ROS event produced up to 12\% of streamflow during the event. This can help explain rapid delivery of water to streams during ROS events, as well as anomalously high contributions of event water during snowmelt hydrographs. In catchments with a persistent snowpack, lateral redistribution of water within the snowpack should be considered a relevant moisture redistribution mechanism.

  abstract = {Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins, and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Another method is repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) that allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence, and (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR-based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of \&lt; 1 km without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz) spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas, thus providing complementary coverage to passive-microwave-based SWE estimation. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems.},

Transport of meltwater occurred primarily along pipes and lateral flow paths allowing the snowpack to melt initially in reverse stratigraphic order. Isotope diffusivities are 2 orders of magnitude faster than estimated from experiments but can be explained by higher temperature and porosity. A better understanding of how snowmelt isotopes change during meltout improves hydrograph separation methods, whereas constraints on isotope diffusivities under warm conditions improve models of ice core records in low-latitude settings.},

The biases due to the systematic seasonal delay depend on the SAR acquisition times, whereas the uncertainties depend on the standard deviation of the random delay, the number of acquisitions, the total time span covered, and the covariance of the time series of the stochastic delay between a pixel and the reference. We study the contribution of the wet delay to the InSAR observations along the western India plate boundary using (i) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer precipitable water vapor, (ii) stratified tropospheric delay estimated from the ERA-I global atmospheric model, and (iii) seven Envisat InSAR swaths. Our analysis indicates that the amplitudes of the annual delay vary by up to 10 cm in this region equivalent to a maximum displacement bias of 24 cm in InSAR line of sight direction between two epochs (assuming Envisat IS6 beam mode). The stratified tropospheric delay correction mitigates this bias and reduces the scatter due to the stochastic delay. For 7 years of Envisat acquisitions along the western India plate boundary, the uncertainty of the InSAR velocity field due to the residual stochastic wet delay after stratified tropospheric delay correction using the ERA-I model is in the order of 2 mm/yr over 100 km and 4 mm/yr over 400 km. We discuss the implication of the derived uncertainties on the full variance-covariance matrix of the InSAR data.},

Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used.},

Eighty-five percent of moment release occurred on a previously unknown strike-slip fault running into the center of Bam, with peak slip of over 2 m occurring at a depth of {$\sim$}5 km.

  abstract = {A technique that uses synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to measure very small (1 cm or less) surface motions with good resolution (10 m) over large swaths (50 km) is presented along with experimental results. The method could be used for accurate measurements of many geophysical phenomena, including swelling and buckling in fault zones, residual displacements from seismic events, and prevolcanic swelling. The method is based on SAR interferometry, where two images are made of a scene by simultaneously flying two physically separated antennas. Then the phases of corresponding pixels are differenced, and altitude formation is deduced from some simple computation and image rectification. It is also possible to use one antenna flown twice over the same scene; then, if the second flight exactly duplicates the track of the first, an interesting possibility occurs. There would be no phase changes between the images at all unless there was a physical change in the scene, such as ground swelling, that would alter the distance from some resolution element to the antenna. Since the phase changes all occur at the short carrier wavelength, the basic limitation on sensitivity is only the phase noise in the system. When the two imaging passes are made from flight tracks that are separated (which is the case with the Seasat images used here), it is no longer possible to distinguish surface changes from the parallax caused by topography. However, with some additional computation, a third image made at some other baseline may be used to remove the topography and leave only the surface changes. This method was applied using Seasat data to an imaging site in Imperial Valley, California, where motion effects were observed that were ascribed to the expansion of water-absorbing clays. Phase change images of this area are shown, along with associated ground truth about the presence of water. Problems with the technique are explored, along with a discussion of future experimental possibilities on upcoming SAR missions like Earth Observing System (EOS), Earth Resources Satellite (ERS 1), SIR-C, and the Venus imaging radar, Magellan.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the seasonal accumulation and ablation of snow across mid-latitude mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere with profound implications for the water resources available to downstream communities and environments. Despite decades of empirical and model-based research on snowmelt-driven streamflow, our ability to predict whether streamflow will increase or decrease in a changing climate remains limited by two factors. First, predictions are fundamentally hampered by high spatial and temporal variability in the processes that control net snow accumulation and ablation across mountainous environments. Second, we lack a consistent and testable framework to coordinate research to determine which dominant mechanisms influencing seasonal snow dynamics are most and least important for streamflow generation in different basins. Our data-driven review marks a step towards the development of such a framework. We first conduct a systematic literature review that synthesizes knowledge about seasonal snowmelt-driven streamflow and how it is altered by climate change, highlighting unsettled questions about how annual streamflow volume is shaped by changing snow dynamics. Drawing from literature, we then propose a framework comprised of three testable, inter-related mechanisms\textemdash snow season mass and energy exchanges, the intensity of snow season liquid water inputs, and the synchrony of energy and water availability. Using data for 537 catchments in the United States, we demonstrate the utility of each mechanism and suggest that streamflow prediction will be more challenging in regions with multiple interacting mechanisms. This framework is intended to inform the research community and improve management predictions as it is tested and refined.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the theoretical relation between interferometric phase and changes in snow water equivalent (SWE) and show results from experiments using ERS- 1/2 tandem data. The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.},

The measurements were conducted during the winters of 1982 and 1983. The following parametric ranges were covered: 1) liquid water content, 0 to 12.3 percent by volume; 2) snow density, 0.09 to 0.42 g cm-3; 3) temperature, 0 to-5 \textbackslash degC and-15\textbackslash degC (scattering-loss measurements); and 4) crystal size, 0.5 to 1.5 mm. The experimental data indicate that the dielectric behavior of wet snow closely follows the dispersion behavior of water. For dry snow, volume scattering is the dominant loss mechanism at 37 GHz. The applicability of several empirical and theoretical mixing models was evaluated using the experimental data. Both the Debye-like semi-empirical model and the theoretical Polder-Van Santen mixing model were found to describe adequately the dielectric behavior of wet snow. However, the Polder-Van Santen model provided a good fit to the measured values of the real and imaginary parts of wet snow only when the shapes of the water inclusions in snow were assumed to be both nonsymmetrical and dependent upon snow water content. The shape variation predicted by the model is consistent with the variation suggested by the physical mechanisms governing the distribution of liquid water in wet snow.},

  abstract = {Seasonally, snow-covered forests are a critical source of water in the Western United States and are subject to major disturbances, including fire, harvest, disease and insect-caused mortality, that have relatively unknown effects on water availability. In this study, we investigated changes in winter season snow accumulation and ablation in a forest following the Las Conchas fire in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. We investigated two competing sets of processes that should determine the peak annual snowpack prior to snowmelt: (1) reduced interception by forest canopy results in greater new snow accumulation and (2) increased winter season ablation of the snowpack results in reduced peak snowpack volumes. These processes were evaluated with approximately 800 spatially distributed manual observations of new snow, 1500 manual observations of peak snowpack, and light detection and ranging-derived snow depth, vegetation and terrain datasets collected prior to the fire. A single snowfall event yielded significantly larger snow depths in the post-burn area versus the unburned area (p {$<$} 0.001), with 25\% to 45\% interception in the unburned area and near zero in the post-burn area. Conversely, the peak snowpack depths were significantly larger in the unburned area compared with the post-burn area (mean of 55 and 47 cm, respectively), despite nearly identical peak snowpacks prior to the fire (72 and 72 cm, respectively). The lack of strong vegetation controls led to less variability at peak snowpack in the post-burn area and a shift towards topographically controlled variability, caused by differences in elevation and aspect, occurring at larger spatial scales. The unburned area had roughly 10\% more water available for melt than the post-burn area, with winter season ablation reducing snowpacks by nearly 50\% prior to melt in the post-burn area. The relative importance of shortwave radiation to the snowpack energy balance and sublimation suggests that the 10\% reductions in peak snow water storage found in these north-facing areas could be a conservative estimate for winter season ablation following fire. Further work is necessary to assess the role that topography plays in altering water partitioning following forest disturbance and the potential implications for ecological health and downstream water resources.

  abstract = {Changing climate and growing water demand are increasing the need for robust streamflow forecasts. Historically, operational streamflow forecasts made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service have relied on precipitation and snow water equivalent observations from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites. We investigate whether also including SNOTEL soil moisture observations improve April-July streamflow volume forecast accuracy at 0, 1, 2, and 3-month lead times at 12 watersheds in Utah and California. We found statistically significant improvement in 0 and 3-month lead time accuracy in 8 of 12 watersheds and 10 of 12 watersheds for 1 and 2-month lead times. Surprisingly, these improvements were insensitive to soil moisture metrics derived from soil physical properties. Forecasts were made with volumetric water content (VWC) averaged from October 1 to the forecast date. By including VWC at the 0-month lead time the forecasts explained 7.3\% more variability and increased the streamflow volume accuracy by 8.4\% on average compared to standard forecasts that already explained an average 77\% of the variability. At 1 to 3-month lead times, the inclusion of soil moisture explained 12.3-26.3\% more variability than the standard forecast on average. Our findings indicate including soil moisture observations increased statistical streamflow forecast accuracy and thus, could potentially improve water supply reliability in regions affected by changing snowpacks.},

  abstract = {Western US forest ecosystems and downstream water supplies are reliant on seasonal snowmelt. Complex feedbacks govern forest\textendash snow interactions in which forests influence the distribution of snow and the timing of snowmelt but are also sensitive to snow water availability. Notwithstanding, few studies have investigated the influence of forest structure on snow distribution, snowmelt and soil moisture response. Using a multi-year record from co-located observations of snow depth and soil moisture, we evaluated the influence of forest-canopy position on snow accumulation and snow depth depletion, and associated controls on the timing of soil moisture response at Boulder Creek, Colorado, Jemez River Basin, New Mexico, and the Wolverton Basin, California. Forest-canopy controls on snow accumulation led to 12\textendash 42 cm greater peak snow depths in open versus under-canopy positions. Differences in accumulation and melt across sites resulted in earlier snow disappearance in open positions at Jemez and earlier snow disappearance in under-canopy positions at Boulder and Wolverton sites. Irrespective of net snow accumulation, we found that peak annual soil moisture was nearly synchronous with the date of snow disappearance at all sites with an average deviation of 12, 3 and 22 days at Jemez, Boulder and Wolverton sites, respectively. Interestingly, sites in the Sierra Nevada showed peak soil moisture prior to snow disappearance at both our intensive study site and the nearby snow telemetry stations. Our results imply that the duration of soil water stress may increase as regional warming or forest disturbance lead to earlier snow disappearance and soil moisture recession in subalpine forests.

The combination of upward looking ground-penetrating radar and conventional snow height sensors enable continuous, nondestructive determinations of {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w in natural snow covers from first surficial wetting until shortly before melt out. We analyze diurnal and seasonal cycles of {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w for 4 years in a flat study site and for three melt seasons on slopes and evaluate model simulations for two different water transport schemes in the snow cover model SNOWPACK. Observed maximum increases in {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w during a day are below 1.7 vol \% (90th percentile) at the flat site. Concerning seasonal characteristics of {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w, less than 10\% of recorded data exceed 5 vol \% at the flat site and 3.5 vol \% at slopes. Both water transport schemes in SNOWPACK underestimate maximum {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w at the flat site systematically for all observed melt seasons, while simulated {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w maxima on slopes are accurate. Implementing observed changes in {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w per day in outflow predictions increases model performance toward higher agreement with lysimeter measurements. Hence, continuously monitoring {$\mathsl{\theta}$}w improves our understanding of liquid water percolation and retention in snow, which is highly relevant for several aspects of the cryosphere such as avalanche formation, catchment hydrology, and ice sheet mass balances.},

  abstract = {The water balance in alpine watersheds is dominated by snowmelt, which provides infiltration, recharges aquifers, controls peak runoff, and is responsible for most of the annual water flow downstream. Accurate estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) is necessary for runoff and flood estimation, but acquiring enough measurements is challenging due to the variability of snow accumulation, ablation, and redistribution at a range of scales in mountainous terrain. We have developed a method for imaging snow stratigraphy and estimating SWE over large distances from a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system mounted on a snowmobile. We mounted commercial GPR systems (500 and 800~MHz) to the front of the snowmobile to provide maximum mobility and ensure that measurements were taken on pristine snow. Images showed detailed snow stratigraphy down to the ground surface over snow depths up to at least 8~m, enabling the elucidation of snow accumulation and redistribution processes. We estimated snow density (and thus SWE, assuming no liquid water) by measuring radar velocity of the snowpack through migration focusing analysis. Results from the Medicine Bow Mountains of southeast Wyoming showed that estimates of snow density from GPR ([Formula: see text]) were in good agreement with those from coincident snow cores ([Formula: see text]). Using this method, snow thickness, snow density, and SWE can be measured over large areas solely from rapidly acquired common-offset GPR profiles, without the need for common-midpoint acquisition or snow cores.},

The spatial associations of cumulative surface movements suggest that the most likely drivers of subsidence are groundwater withdrawal and surficial drainage/dewatering activities. High subsidence rates are observed localized around some major industrial facilities and can affect nearby flood control infrastructure. Substantial subsidence is observed to occur rapidly from shallow compaction in highly localized areas, which is why it could be missed in subsidence surveys relying on point measurements at limited locations.},

NISAR data will clarify spatially and temporally complex phenomena, including ecosystem disturbances, ice sheet collapse, and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides. It provides societally relevant data that will enable better protection of life and property. The mission, a NASA-ISRO partnership, uses two fully polarimetric SARs, one at L-band (L-SAR) and one at S-band (S-SAR), in exact repeating orbits every 12 days that allows interferometric combination of data on repeated passes. NASA provides the L-SAR; a shared deployable reflector; an engineering payload that supports mission-specific data handling, navigation and communication functions; science observation planning and L-SAR data processing. ISRO provides the S-SAR, spacecraft, launch vehicle, satellite operations, and S-SAR data processing. The mission will be launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, India. Mission development has addressed many unique challenges and incorporates many ``firsts'' for a jointly-developed free-flyer radar science mission.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews measurement techniques and corresponding devices used to determine the physical properties of the seasonal snowpack from distances close to the ground surface. The review is placed in the context of the need for scientific observations of snowpack variables that provide inputs for predictive hydrological models that help to advance scientific understanding of geophysical processes related to snow in the near-surface cryosphere. Many of these devices used to measure snow are invasive and require the snowpack to be disrupted, thereby precluding the possibility for multiple measurements to be made at the same sampling location. Moreover, many devices rely on the use of empirical calibration equations that may not be valid at all geographic locations. The spatial density of observations with most snow measurement devices is often inadequate. There is a need for improved automation of snowpack measurement instrumentation with an emphasis on field-based feedback of measurement validity in lieu of postprocessing of samples or data at a lab or office location. The scientific future of snow measurement instrumentation thereby requires a synthesis between science and engineering principles that takes into consideration geophysics and the physics of device operation.},

There are however, few datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly wind slab (65\%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain (35\%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential correlation length; lex), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3\&a) and compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a scaling factor ({$\phi$}) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of lex, minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to {$<$} 1.1 dB. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller contributing microstructures of the wind slab.},

  abstract = {The water resources of the western United States depend heavily on snowpack to store part of the wintertime precipitation into the drier summer months. A well-documented shift toward earlier runoff in recent decades has been attributed to 1) more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow and 2) earlier snowmelt. The present study addresses the former, documenting a regional trend toward smaller ratios of winter-total snowfall water equivalent (SFE) to winter-total precipitation (P) during the period 1949\textendash 2004. The trends toward reduced SFE are a response to warming across the region, with the most significant reductions occurring where winter wet-day minimum temperatures, averaged over the study period, were warmer than Ϫ5\textdegree C. Most SFE reductions were associated with winter wet-day temperature increases between 0\textdegree{} and ϩ3\textdegree C over the study period. Warmings larger than this occurred mainly at sites where the mean temperatures were cool enough that the precipitation form was less susceptible to warming trends. The trends toward reduced SFE/P ratios were most pronounced in March regionwide and in January near the West Coast, corresponding to widespread warming in these months. While mean temperatures in March were sufficiently high to allow the warming trend to produce SFE/P declines across the study region, mean January temperatures were cooler, with the result that January SFE/P impacts were restricted to the lower elevations near the West Coast.},

This paper reviews various methods for measuring snow and glacier ice properties with satellite remote sensing. These methods have been improving with the use of new satellite sensors, like the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) during the last decade, leading to the development of new and powerful methods, such as SAR interferometry for glacier velocity, digital elevation model generation of ice sheets, or snow cover mapping. Some methods still try to overcome the limitations of present sensors, but future satellites will have much increased capability, for example, the ability to measure the whole optical spectrum or SAR sensors with multiple polarization or frequencies. Among the methods presented are the satellite-derived determination of surface albedo, snow extent, snow volume, snow grain size, surface temperature, glacier facies, glacier velocities, glacier extent, and ice sheet topography. In this review, emphasis is put on the principles and theory of each satellite remote sensing method. An extensive list of references, with an emphasis on studies from the 1990s, allows the reader to delve into specific topics.},

  abstract = {Large scale mapping of snow water equivalent (SWE) is a long-lasting request in many scientific and economical fields. Active and passive microwave remote sensing methods are explored, as local methods cannot be generalized due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the snow pack. Microwaves interact with snow by absorption, scattering, and refraction. For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20 GHz, absorption and scattering in the snow volume are negligible compared with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground. The signal delay caused by refraction can be measured with differential radar interferometry, but phase wrapping errors and temporal decorrelation must be considered. We demonstrate that large {$\Delta$}SWE can be accurately determined from dense time series of differential interferograms at X- and Ku-band by temporal integration. Lost phase cycles are reconstructed with a two-frequency approach. Temporal decorrelation is minimized by a temporal resolution of 4 h. A linear function between {$\Delta$}SWE and phase difference is derived, which deviates only a few percent from the exact solution and which depends negligibly on snow density and stratigraphy. {$\Delta$}SWE retrieved from observations of the SnowScat instrument (SSI) were validated against observed SWE from different reference instruments, installed at a test site near the town of Sodankyl\"a, Finland. An accuracy below {$\pm$}6 mm SWE was achieved at frequencies of 10 and 16 GHz for up to 200 mm of {$\Delta$}SWE. An exceptionally high temporal coherence was observed for up to 30 days for dry snow, whereas for wet snow it decayed within hours.},

Therefore, it has been selected as a super-testsite for the TanDEM-X satellite mission. Dense time series with a repeat interval down to 11 d were acquired between 2011 and 2019 using two polarizations (HH and VV) and across-track baselines of 0-1 km. To evaluate the use of interferometric single-pass synthetic aperture radar mission for glaciological applications, we implemented a processing pipeline in interactive data language (IDL) and computed 130 digital elevation models (DEMs) from bistatic radar interferograms. We present a method to circumvent a common pitfall during orthorectification of radar DEM differences. Regression analysis of DEM time series shows a height loss of up to 8 m a\textsuperscript{-1\$} on the tongue and 1.5 m a\textsuperscript{-1\$} when averaged over the whole glacier area. In spring 2013, we observed X-band penetration depths of 4{$\pm$}2 m in the accumulation area. For strongly crevassed areas, the coherence drops already to 0.5 for across-track baselines B{$\perp$} {$>$} 200 m. With patch-based incoherent offset tracking, we obtained an almost complete 200 m resolution velocity map. Velocities reach up to 0.8 m d\textsuperscript{-1\$}, show a seasonal variability of {$\pm$}0.05 m d\textsuperscript{-1\$}, and agree within 0.04 m d\textsuperscript{-1\$}(root mean square error) with field measurements. Copolar phase differences suggest an approximation of snow accumulation. We demonstrate orthorectification of the backscatter intensity using simultaneously acquired TanDEM-X interferograms, which allows for the decoupling of horizontal velocity estimates from phase-center height changes due to penetration and ice melt.},

  abstract = {The potential of retrieving the bottom layer snow density and soil permittivity under dry snow cover conditions from L-band passive microwave observations was analyzed using multi-angular brightness temperatures measured at horizontal and vertical polarization over two test sites in northern Finland. The near-continuous time series of L-band brightness temperatures covers a total of six winter seasons, over both dry mineral soil in a forest clearing, and organic soil over a wetland site. Detailed measurements of snow and soil conditions are available from both sites. Complementing a previous theoretical study, we show that dry snow cover influences the observed L-band brightness temperatures as a result of both impedance matching and changes in the refraction angle at the snow\textendash soil interface. Exploiting these effects, we demonstrate the retrieval of the bottom layer snow density and the influence of dry snow cover on simultaneously retrieved soil permittivity \textemdash{} a consideration which is currently not accounted for in Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) retrievals of soil permittivity in the presence of dry snow. Depending on season, the mean bias error between retrieved and in situ snow density measured in the lower snow layers was between -6 kg m-3 and 15 kg m-3 for the forest clearing site, and between 37 kg m-3 and 90 kg m-3 for the wetland site, demonstrating the feasibility of the retrieval approach at the plot scale. In winter conditions, the ground permittivity retrieved without considering the impact of dry snow on L-band emission was, on average, 35\% lower for both test sites, which indicates possible errors in current SMOS ground permittivity retrievals under dry snow conditions. The application of SMOS data to simultaneously retrieve dry snow density and ground permittivity is a complex task due to heterogeneous land cover and snow/ soil conditions within SMOS pixels ({$\approx$}45 km resolution). An approach that considers land cover variations and the spatial variability of snow cover is required to fully determine the feasibility of the methodology to aid e.g. improving estimates snow water equivalent from other sensors, and to take into account effects of dry snow in SMOS-based retrievals of ground permittivities. The results should also be applicable to other L-band sensors in space, such as the recently launched NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission.},

Over the journal's second 25 years, that changed remarkably, and remote sensing is now widely used in hydrology and other geophysical sciences. We attribute this evolution to production of data sets that scientists not well versed in remote sensing can use, and to educational initiatives like NASA's Earth System Science Fellowship program that has supported over a thousand scientists, many in hydrology. We review progress in remote sensing in hydrology from a water balance perspective. We argue that progress is primarily attributable to a creative use of existing and past satellite sensors to estimate such variables as evapotranspiration rates or water storage in lakes and reservoirs and to new and planned missions. Recent transforming technologies include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and U.S. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Future missions include Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) to measure river discharge and lake, reservoir, and wetland storage. Measurement of some important hydrologic variables remains problematic: retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) from space remains elusive especially in mountain areas, even though snow cover extent is well observed, and was the topic of 4 of the first 5 remote sensing papers published in WRR. We argue that this area deserves more strategic thinking from the hydrology community.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) in a warming climate is of critical interest to scientists and the general public in the context of future sea-level rise. An improved understanding of temporal and spatial variability of snow accumulation will reduce uncertainties in GrIS mass balance models and improve projections of Greenland's contribution to sea-level rise, currently estimated at 0.089\,{$\pm$}\,0.03\,m by 2100. Here we analyze 25 NASA Operation IceBridge accumulation radar flights totaling \,{$>$}\,\,17\,700\,km from 2013 to 2014 to determine snow accumulation in the GrIS dry snow and percolation zones over the past 100\textendash 300~years. IceBridge accumulation rates are calculated and used to validate accumulation rates from three regional climate models. Averaged over all 25 flights, the RMS difference between the models and IceBridge accumulation is between 0.023\,{$\pm$}\,0.019 and 0.043\,{$\pm$}\,0.029\,m\,w.e.\,a-1, although each model shows significantly larger differences from IceBridge accumulation on a regional basis. In the southeast region, for example, the Mod\`ele Atmosph\'erique R\'egional (MARv3.5.2) overestimates by an average of 20.89\,{$\pm$}\,6.75\,\% across the drainage basin. Our results indicate that these regional differences between model and IceBridge accumulation are large enough to significantly alter GrIS surface mass balance estimates. Empirical orthogonal function analysis suggests that the first two principal components account for 33 and 19\,\% of the variance, and correlate with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. Regions that disagree strongest with climate models are those in which we have the fewest IceBridge data points, requiring additional in situ measurements to verify model uncertainties.},

In this application, a theoretical method of snow depth estimation with repeat-pass InSAR measurements was proposed, and a preliminary sensitivity analysis of snow phase changes versus the incident angle and snow density was developed. Moreover, the snow density and incident angle parameters were analyzed and calibrated, and the local incident angle was used as a substitute for the satellite incident angle to improve the snow depth estimation. From the results, the coherence images showed that a high degree of coherence can be found for dry snow, and, apart from the effect of snow, land use/cover change due to a long temporal baseline and geometric distortion due to the rugged terrain were the main constraints for InSAR technique to measure snow depth and SWE in this area. The result of snow depth estimation between July 2008 and February 2009 demonstrated that the average snow depth was about 20\,cm, which was consistent with the field survey results.

  abstract = {Abstract. Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100\,m, 500\,m, and 1\,km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017\textendash 2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500\,m and 1\,km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20\,\%\textendash 30\,\% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3\,m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100\,m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.},

More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1\,km{$^2$} resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from \textasciitilde 4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change.},

The critical role of snow in water supply has been frequently quantified using the ratio of snowmelt-derived runoff to total runoff. However, current estimates of the fraction of annual runoff generated by snowmelt are not based on systematic analyses. Here based on hydrological model simulations and a new snowmelt tracking algorithm, we show that 53\% of the total runoff in the western United States originates as snowmelt, despite only 37\% of the precipitation falling as snow. In mountainous areas, snowmelt is responsible for 70\% of the total runoff. By 2100, the contribution of snowmelt to runoff will decrease by one third for the western U.S. in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Snowmelt-derived runoff currently makes up two thirds of the inflow to the region's major reservoirs. We argue that substantial impacts on water supply are likely in a warmer climate.},

  abstract = {SnowModel is a spatially distributed snow-evolution modeling system designed for application in landscapes, climates, and conditions where snow occurs. It is an aggregation of four submodels: MicroMet defines meteorological forcing conditions, EnBal calculates surface energy exchanges, SnowPack simulates snow depth and water-equivalent evolution, and SnowTran-3D accounts for snow redistribution by wind. Since each of these submodels was originally developed and tested for nonforested conditions, details describing modifications made to the submodels for forested areas are provided. SnowModel was created to run on grid increments of 1 to 200 m and temporal increments of 10 min to 1 day. It can also be applied using much larger grid increments, if the inherent loss in high-resolution (subgrid) information is acceptable. Simulated processes include snow accumulation; blowing-snow redistribution and sublimation; forest canopy interception, unloading, and sublimation; snow-density evolution; and snowpack melt. Conceptually, SnowModel includes the first-order physics required to simulate snow evolution within each of the global snow classes (i.e., ice, tundra, taiga, alpine/mountain, prairie, maritime, and ephemeral). The required model inputs are 1) temporally varying fields of precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity obtained from meteorological stations and/or an atmospheric model located within or near the simulation domain; and 2) spatially distributed fields of topography and vegetation type. SnowModel's ability to simulate seasonal snow evolution was compared against observations in both forested and nonforested landscapes. The model closely reproduced observed snow-water-equivalent distribution, time evolution, and interannual variability patterns.},

Combining diagnostic tools of mixing models and endmember mixing analysis (EMMA) shows that streamflow at East Fork Jemez River and San Antonio West (both {$>$} 120 km2) was controlled by mixing of three endmembers: near-surface runoff, subsurface flow and groundwater. The contribution of near-surface runoff was primarily controlled by soil moisture and evapotranspiration, and was much higher in wet years (2005 and 2007) than a dry year (2006) and during the spring snowmelt than in the summer monsoon. Streamflow at the San Antonio Toledo headwater catchment (55 km2) was dominated by subsurface flow alone, consistent with the distribution of coarse-textured, well-drained soils at higher elevations. During the snowmelt period and at catchments with higher near-surface runoff contributions, nutrient concentrations in streams were found to be higher, as a result of nutrient leaching from the upper organic-rich soil horizons by near-surface runoff. These results highlight the importance of seasonal and interannual variability of hydrology in semi-arid regions, and the role of flowpaths in controlling sources of nutrients in streams.

Samples were collected from snow, subsurface flow from hillslopes, and streamflow at Redondo and La Jara Creeks from December 2004 to July 2005. A new modeling procedure was developed by combining diagnostic tools of mixing models and end-member mixing analysis to evaluate the assumptions of mixing models. This procedure was successfully used to determine conservative chemical tracers, identify the number of end-members that contribute to streamflow, and evaluate eligibility of end-members. The results show that streamflow at Redondo Creek was generated from two end-members: lateral subsurface flow ({$\sim$}80\%) and thermal meteoric water ({$\sim$}20\%). Streamflow at La Jara Creek was primarily from lateral subsurface flow alone. Overland flow of snowmelt was not a significant contributor to streamflow in either catchment. Lateral subsurface flow is an important process of streamflow generation in semiarid environments in the southwest United States and should play a critical role in regulating biogeochemical cycles.},

Here we use the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) weather model to hindcast atmospheric delays at SAR acquisition times over both mountainous and flat regions. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing it to interferograms formed using acquisitions with short temporal baselines (\textquestiondown 4 months). Our results show that for flat regions the model not only misestimates atmospheric delay in magnitude and location but also largely underestimates the (horizontal) spatial variation (turbulent mixing) of the delay. In mountainous areas it can model the height dependent (vertical stratification) part of total delay correctly in some cases but not always. By removing the height dependent part we find again that the model may underestimate the spatial variation of the delay. Therefore, we conclude that the WRF weather model is in general not reliable for the operational mitigation of atmospheric delay in interferograms.},

Glacier and snowmelt from the high altitude Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges are the largest drivers of discharge in the upper Indus Basin (UIB), and contribute significantly to Indus flows. Complex climatology and topography, coupled with the challenges of field study and meteorological measurement in these rugged ranges, elicit notable uncertainties in predicting seasonal runoff as well as cryospheric response to changes in climate. Here we utilize Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to track ablation season development of wet snow in the Shigar Watershed of the Karakoram Mountains in Pakistan from 2015 to 2018. We exploit opportune local image acquisition times to highlight diurnal differences in radar indications of wet snow, and examine the spatial and temporal contexts of radar diurnal differences for 2015, 2017, and 2018 ablation seasons. Radar classifications for each ablation season show spatial and temporal patterns that indicate a dry winter snowpack undergoing diurnal surface melt-refreeze cycles, transitioning to surface snow that remains wet both day and night, and finally snow free conditions following melt out. Diurnally differing SAR signals may offer insights into important snowpack energy balance processes that precede melt out, which could provide useful constraints for both glacier mass balance modeling and runoff forecasting in remote alpine watersheds.},

Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2, with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This variability makes extrapolation of point measurements of snowpack properties difficult and prone to error, but these types of measurements are used to estimate SWE and stability across entire mountain ranges. Radar technology provides a promising alternative to point measurements, because large areas can be covered quickly and non-intrusively. There is great potential for obtaining information on a large spatial scale from airborne applications. Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar measurements were made from the ground in several different alpine snowpacks, along with manual and in situ electrical measurements. The surface and ground reflections from the radar data, combined with an average density estimate, can provide a useful estimate of SWE. In addition, the locations of internal reflections are highly correlated with both visually identified layers and measured changes in in situ dielectric properties.},

  abstract = {Interannual variability of mountain snowpack has important consequences for ecological and socioeconomic systems, yet changes in variability have not been widely examined under future climates. Physically based snowpack simulations for historical (1970\textendash 1999) and high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5) mid-21st century (2050\textendash 2079) periods were used to assess changes in the variability of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) and SWEmax timing across the western United States. Models show robust declines in the interannual variability of SWEmax in regions where precipitation is projected to increasingly fall as rain. The average frequency of consecutive snow drought years (SWEmax {$<$} historical 25th percentile) is projected to increase from 6.6\% to 42.2\% of years. Models also project increases in the variability of SWEmax timing, suggesting reduced reliability of when SWEmax occurs. Differences in physiography and regional climate create distinct spatial patterns of change in snowpack variability that will require adaptive strategies for environmental resource management. Plain Language Summary A wealth of research has established that warming temperatures associated with climate change in the western United States will generally reduce snowpack accumulation and result in earlier snowmelt timing, with important consequences for water resources and ecosystems. However, changes in the variability of snowpack conditions between years have not been well established. We analyze simulated snowpack data for historical and future climate scenarios and find that changes in variability differ across the western United States. Variability of annual maximum snowpack between years decreases while the timing of peak snow accumulation becomes more variable, particularly in areas transitioning from snow- to rain-dominated precipitation. We also find that consecutive years with very low or early snowpack will become much more frequent. These findings highlight the need to consider changes in snowpack variability in climate change impact assessments and adaptation planning.},

New measurements of with improved accuracy were made with a specially designed resonator operating near 1 GHz. The coaxial sensor accurately defines the sample volume whose actual mass can be determined to give the density of the snow sample. A special electronic instrument, called a resometer, enabled accurate and rapid measurements under field conditions. Some 90 measurements of different kinds of dry snow (fresh, old, wind-pressed snow, depth hear, and refrozen crusts) were made at test sites in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. The data indicate that /spl epsiv/ is a function of snow density only, given that the standard deviation of 0.006 from the fitted curve is just due to the expected measurement errors. The interpretation of these data in terms of physical mixing theory favors the effective medium formula of Polder and van Santen (1946). The data allow to relate the average axial ratio X as a function of ice volume fraction. Both prolate and oblate spheroids can explain the data. Independent reasoning gives preference to oblate particles. In both cases, the axial ratio increases with increasing fraction up to a critical value of 0.33, followed by a decrease at still higher fractions. The destructive metamorphism of slowly compacting snow explains the increase of X, while the following decrease might be due to sintering. So far, no effect on /spl epsiv/ by a liquid-like surface layer on the ice grains at temperatures between -10/spl deg/C and 0/spl deg/C has been observed.},

  abstract = {Abstract. There is significant uncertainty regarding the spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal snow on glaciers, despite being a fundamental component of glacier mass balance. To address this knowledge gap, we collected repeat, spatially extensive high-frequency ground-penetrating radar (GPR) observations on two glaciers in Alaska during the spring of 5~consecutive years. GPR measurements showed steep snow water equivalent (SWE) elevation gradients at both sites; continental Gulkana Glacier's SWE gradient averaged 115\,mm 100\,m-1 and maritime Wolverine Glacier's gradient averaged 440\,mm 100\,m-1 (over {$>$}\,1000\,m). We extrapolated GPR point observations across the glacier surface using terrain parameters derived from digital elevation models as predictor variables in two statistical models (stepwise multivariable linear regression and regression trees). Elevation and proxies for wind redistribution had the greatest explanatory power, and exhibited relatively time-constant coefficients over the study period. Both statistical models yielded comparable estimates of glacier-wide average SWE (1\,\% average difference at Gulkana, 4\,\% average difference at Wolverine), although the spatial distributions produced by the models diverged in unsampled regions of the glacier, particularly at Wolverine. In total, six different methods for estimating the glacier-wide winter balance average agreed within {$\pm$}11\,\%. We assessed interannual variability in the spatial pattern of snow accumulation predicted by the statistical models using two quantitative metrics. Both glaciers exhibited a high degree of temporal stability, with {$\sim$}85\,\% of the glacier area experiencing less than 25\,\% normalized absolute variability over this 5-year interval. We found SWE at a sparse network (3 stakes per glacier) of long-term glaciological stake sites to be highly correlated with the GPR-derived glacier-wide average. We estimate that interannual variability in the spatial pattern of winter SWE accumulation is only a small component (4\,\%\textendash 10\,\% of glacier-wide average) of the total mass balance uncertainty and thus, our findings support the concept that sparse stake networks effectively measure interannual variability in winter balance on glaciers, rather than some temporally varying spatial pattern of snow accumulation.},

The NASA SnowEx campaign is focused on addressing the primary gaps in snow remote sensing in order to gain an improved spatiotemporal understanding of this important resource and to further efforts toward a future satellite-based snow remote sensing mission. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is an efficient and mature approach for measuring snow depth and SWE. We collected 1.3 million GPR snow depth observations during the NASA SnowEx 2017 campaign, yielding a spatially extensive ( 133-km total length) and high-resolution ( 10-cm lateral spacing) validation data set to assess various remote sensing and modeling approaches. We found high correlation between the GPR and manual snow probe derived snow depths (r = 0.89, p {$<$} 0.0001, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 18 cm), but a median difference of -10 cm, which we attribute, in part, to probe penetration into the unfrozen subsurface. We also compared GPR-derived snow depths to two other independent estimates of snow depth, as an example of how this data set can be used for validation of remote sensing techniques: Airborne Snow Observatory lidar-derived snow depths (r = 0.90, p {$<$} 0.0001, median difference = -1 cm, RMSE = 14 cm) and preliminary DigitalGlobe WorldView-3 satellite-derived snow depths (r = 0.70, p {$<$} 0.0001, median difference = -3 cm, RMSE = 24 cm).},

Hence, this paper focuses on the development of performance requirements for the correction of ionospheric effects in low-frequency SAR data. The requirements are derived considering the data quality needs of a set of SAR applications and will ensure the SAR data after ionospheric correction to meet calibration specifications and maintain full performance during all ionospheric conditions. The proposed requirements can serve as a benchmark for a performance assessment of ionospheric correction methods and will help define their suitability for operational implementation.

Most previous InSAR studies have utilized spaceborne InSAR platforms, but InSAR datasets over permafrost landscapes collected from airborne platforms have been steadily growing in recent years. Most existing algorithms dedicated toward retrieval of permafrost physical properties were originally developed for spaceborne InSAR platforms. In this study, which is the first in a two part series, we introduce a series of calibration techniques developed to apply a novel joint retrieval algorithm for permafrost active layer thickness retrieval to an airborne InSAR dataset acquired in 2017 by NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar over Alaska and Western Canada. We demonstrate how InSAR measurement uncertainties are mitigated by these calibration methods and quantify remaining measurement uncertainties with a novel method of modeling interferometric phase uncertainty using a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, we discuss the impact of native SAR resolution on InSAR measurements, the limitation of using few interferograms per retrieval, and the implications of our findings for cross-comparison of airborne and spaceborne InSAR datasets acquired over Arctic regions underlain by permafrost.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The current drought over the Colorado River Basin has raised concerns that the US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) may impose water shortages over the lower portion of the basin for the first time in history. The guidelines that determine levels of shortage are affected by relatively short-term (3 to 7 month) forecasts determined by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) using the National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecasting System (RFS) hydrologic model. While these forecasts by the CBRFC are useful, water managers within the basin are interested in long-term projections of streamflow, particularly under changing climate conditions. In this study, a bias-corrected, statistically downscaled dataset of projected climate is used to force the NWS RFS utilized by the CBRFC to derive projections of streamflow over the Green, Gunnison, and San Juan River headwater basins located within the Colorado River Basin. This study evaluates the impact of changing climate to evapotranspiration rates and contributes to a better understanding of how hydrologic processes change under varying climate conditions. The impact to evapotranspiration rates is taken into consideration and incorporated into the development of streamflow projections over Colorado River headwater basins in this study. Additionally, the NWS RFS is modified to account for impacts to evapotranspiration due to changing temperature over the basin. Adjusting evapotranspiration demands resulted in a 6 \% to 13 \% average decrease in runoff over the Gunnison River Basin when compared to static evapotranspiration rates. Streamflow projections derived using projections of future climate and the NWS RFS provided by the CBRFC resulted in decreased runoff in 2 of the 3 basins considered. Over the Gunnison and San Juan River basins, a 10 \% to 15 \% average decrease in basin runoff is projected through the year 2099. However, over the Green River basin, a 5 \% to 8 \% increase in basin runoff is projected through 2099. Evidence of nonstationary behavior is apparent over the Gunnison and San Juan River basins.},

At both sites, vegetation structure largely controlled the distribution of snow accumulation with 29\% greater accumulation in open versus under-canopy locations. Snow ablation rates were diminished by 39\% in under-canopy locations, indicating increases in vegetation density act to extend the duration of the snowmelt season. Similarly, differences in climate altered snow-season duration, snowmelt infiltration and evapotranspiration. Commencement of the growing season was coincident with melt-water input to the soil and lagged behind springtime increases in air temperature by 12 days on average, ranging from 2 to 33 days under warmer and colder conditions, respectively. Similarly, the timing of peak soil moisture was highly variable, lagging behind springtime increases in air temperature by 42 and 31 days on average at the Colorado and New Mexico sites, respectively. Latent heat flux and associated evaporative loss to the atmosphere was 28\% greater for the year with earlier onset of snowmelt infiltration. Given the large and variable fraction of precipitation that was partitioned into water vapour loss, the combined effects of changes in vegetation structure, climate and associated changes to the timing and magnitude of snowmelt may have large effects on the partitioning of snowmelt into evapotranspiration, surface runoff and ground water recharge.

  abstract = {Ice velocity is a fundamental parameter in studying the dynamics of ice sheets. Until recently, no complete mapping of Antarctic ice motion had been available due to calibration uncertainties and lack of basic data. Here, we present a method for calibrating and mosaicking an ensemble of InSAR satellite measurements of ice motion from six sensors: the Japanese ALOS PALSAR, the European Envisat ASAR, ERS-1 and ERS-2, and the Canadian RADARSAT-1 and RADARSAT-2. Ice motion calibration is made difficult by the sparsity of in-situ reference points and the shear size of the study area. A sensor-dependent data stacking scheme is applied to reduce measurement uncertainties. The resulting ice velocity mosaic has errors in magnitude ranging from 1 m/yr in the interior regions to 17 m/yr in coastal sectors and errors in flow direction ranging from less than 0.5{$\smwhtcircle$} in areas of fast flow to unconstrained direction in sectors of slow motion. It is important to understand how these mosaics are calibrated to understand the inner characteristics of the velocity products as well as to plan future InSAR acquisitions in the Antarctic. As an example, we show that in broad sectors devoid of ice-motion control, it is critical to operate ice motion mapping on a large scale to avoid pitfalls of calibration uncertainties that would make it difficult to obtain quality products and especially construct reliable time series of ice motion needed to detect temporal changes.},

Accordingly, we conducted an initial vegetation survey to help characterize the range of variation and condition among the preserve's ecosystems and to provide a foundation for the development of a high-resolution vegetation map to be used in planning and management. In 2001, we established 100 vegetation plots in the preserve's forests and grasslands that have detailed species inventories, site and tree stand characterizations, and repeat photo points. In this first year, sampling was focused on describing reference conditions in stands that had the fewest impacts from past logging and grazing or those with special biological elements. Data from these plots were used to develop a vegetation classification that conforms to the National Vegetation Classification system standards. The classification serves as an organizing tool for information on the preserve's ecosystems and for defining map units for a vegetation map to be developed in succeeding years.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel satellite constellation series, developed and operated by the European Space Agency, represents the dedicated space component of the European Copernicus program, committed to long-term operational services in environment, climate and security. We developed, tested and evaluated an algorithm for generating maps of snowmelt area from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel-1 mission. For snowmelt classification, a change detection method is applied, using multitemporal dual-polarized SAR data acquired in Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode, the basic operation mode over land surfaces. Of particular benefit for wet snow retrievals are the high instrument stability, the high spatial resolution across the 250 km wide swath, and the short revisit time. In order to study the impact of polarization, we generated maps of melting snow using data of the VV-polarized channel, the VH-polarized channel and a combined VV- and VH-based channel using a weighting function that accounts for effects of the local incidence angle. Comparisons are performed with snow maps derived from Landsat images over study areas in the Alps and in Iceland. The pixel-by-pixel comparisons show good agreement between the snow products of the two sensors, with the best performance for retrievals based on the combined (VV and VH) channel and a minor decline for the VH-based product. The VV-based snowmelt extent product shows a drop-off in quality over areas with steep terrain because of the decreasing backscatter contrast of snow-covered versus snow-free surfaces on fore-slopes. The investigations demonstrate the excellent capability of the Sentinel-1 mission for operational monitoring of snowmelt areas.},

Multiple repeat-pass acquisitions were obtained with an airborne polarimetric C-band and L-band SAR, covering days without snowfall, as well as two snowfall events of different intensity. SWE maps, deduced from the observed change of the RP-InSAR phase delay in the snowpack, show good agreement with field measurements. Whereas L-band data are well applicable for SWE mapping of both snowfall events, the 2 {$\pi$} phase ambiguity and low coherence prevent the use of C-band data for the snowfall event of high intensity. The analysis of the campaign data is going on, addressing among other topics the application of RP-InSAR for SWE monitoring within the planned L-band SAR mission ROSE-L of the European Copernicus program and by means of geostationary C-band SAR as proposed for the Hydroterra mission.},

These forecasts are for 29 unregulated rivers with diversity in geography and climate. Deterministic evaluations revealed strong correspondence between observations and forecasts issued 1 April. Forecasts issued earlier in the season were more uncertain yet remained skillful. The average change in forecast performance between January and April was primarily linked to the climatological seasonal cycle of precipitation: regions with climatologically wet winters and dry springs (e.g., California) showed much more forecast improvement between January and April than did regions with dry winters and wet springs (e.g., western Great Plains, Colorado Front Range). Other climatological factors played a secondary role; for example, mixed rain\textendash snow basins in the Pacific Northwest did not show as significant an improvement in skill versus lead time as might otherwise be expected. Mixed trends in 1 April forecast skill were noted since the 1980s, with increased skill in California and Nevada, and a decline in skill in the Colorado River basin. Increased variability in streamflow was also noted across most of the western United States, although this did not appear to be the only factor responsible for trends in forecast skill.},

  abstract = {Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in many of the world's mountainous regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/ SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.},

The model analyzes the MODIS visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands with multiple endmember spectral mixtures from a library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model specific to a scene's illumination geometry; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. We validate the model with fractional snow cover estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data, at 30 m resolution, for the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, high plains of Colorado, and Himalaya. Grain size measurements are validated with field measurements during the Cold Land Processes Experiment, and albedo retrievals are validated with in situ measurements in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The pixelweighted average RMS error for snow-covered area across 31 scenes is 5\%, ranging from 1\% to 13\%. The mean absolute error for grain size was 51 \textmu m and the mean absolute error for albedo was 4.2\%. Fractional snow cover errors are relatively insensitive to solar zenith angle. Because MODSCAG is a physically based algorithm that accounts for the spatial and temporal variation in surface reflectances of snow and other surfaces, it is capable of global snow cover mapping in its more computationally efficient, operational mode.},

It now provides a means to address previously inaccessible questions and offers input to increasingly complex models of magmatic processes. Here, we review how technological advances in InSAR during 2010-2020 have facilitated our ability to monitor and interpret volcanic processes, primarily through rapid and accurate observations of the changing surfaces at active volcanoes worldwide. Specifically, we examine how current systems achieve excellent resolution in time and space, provide global coverage, and generate products that are easy to use by non-specialists\textemdash factors that have often limited the practical study of volcanoes using radar measurements. We also look to the future, offering our perspective about how advancements in technology and data management in the decade to come will increase the value and accessibility of InSAR applied to the geodetic study of volcanoes and monitoring of hazardous volcanic processes. New developments will include the launch of additional satellites by both public space agencies and private companies, as well as implementation of algorithms for exploiting the growing volumes of data. To meet their full potential, these efforts will require coordination between data users and data providers so that the relevant imagery is acquired, made available to volcanologists in a timely fashion, and utilized to assess and mitigate volcanic hazards.},

  abstract = {Density is a fundamental property of porous media such as snow. A wide range of snow properties and physical processes are linked to density, but few studies have addressed the uncertainty in snow density measurements. No study has yet quantitatively considered the recent advances in snow measurement methods such as micro-computed tomography (\textmu CT) in alpine snow. During the MicroSnow Davos 2014 workshop, different approaches to measure snow density were applied in a controlled laboratory environment and in the field. Overall, the agreement between \textmu CT and gravimetric methods (density cutters) was 5 to 9 \%, with a bias of -5 to 2 \%, expressed as percentage of the mean \textmu CT density. In the field, density cutters overestimate (1 to 6 \%) densities below and underestimate (1 to 6 \%) densities above a threshold between 296 to 350 kg m-3, dependent on cutter type. Using the mean density per layer of all measurement methods applied in the field (\textmu CT, box, wedge, and cylinder cutters) and ignoring ice layers, the variation between the methods was 2 to 5 \% with a bias of -1 to 1 \%. In general, our result suggests that snow densities measured by different methods agree within 9 \%. However, the density profiles resolved by the measurement methods differed considerably. In particular, the millimeter-scale density variations revealed by the high-resolution \textmu CT contrasted the thick layers with sharp boundaries introduced by the observer. In this respect, the unresolved variation, i.e., the density variation within a layer which is lost by lower resolution sampling or layer aggregation, is critical when snow density measurements are used in numerical simulations.},

The presence of melt water in the snowpack causes a marked increase in brightness temperature which can be used to predict snowpack priming and timing of runoff.

In this study, we modify a commonly applied multitemporal technique, Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) analysis, to process InSAR data in an area where pumping for crop irrigation creates seasonally variable deformation. We propagate the uncertainty due to decorrelation through the InSAR processing chain and calculate the uncertainty in the deformation for all selected pixels. The standard deviation of the uncertainty in the deformation ranges from 1 to 5 mm. Finally, we investigate how the InSAR coherence affects the standard deviation of the estimated deformation. Through a synthetic study, we show that given the mean coherence and standard deviation of coherence, we can determine the mean standard deviation of the final deformation estimates. This allows us to optimize InSAR processing to identify which pixels can provide the uncertainty desired in the final deformation time series.},

  abstract = {The effects of radiation scattering and sheltering on snow distributions are poorly understood in montane regions of the southwestern United States. To examine this, we develop a single-layer, distributed snow model (DSM) that includes canopy interception, and radiation scattering and sheltering. In our simulations, we distinguish between local and remote controls on shortwave radiation. This allows us to vary the representation of the effective albedo of the surrounding terrain from a vegetated to a snow-covered landscape and examine the impact this has on snow accumulation and melt. The distributed model is applied to La Jara catchment in the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, during the 2004\textendash 2005 winter season. Results indicate that a landscape-scale albedo controlled by vegetation has little effect on local scale-processes, such as incoming shortwave radiation and maximum snow water equivalent (SWE). This implies that increases from scattered light are nearly equal to the losses of radiation from remote sheltering. In contrast, when landscape-scale albedo is controlled by snow cover or by a proposed dynamic method accounting for snow in the vegetation canopy, there are large deviations in the spatiotemporal distributions of shortwave radiation and SWE due to scattered radiation exceeding the sheltering effects of remote topography. Our study results indicate that remote interactions of radiation, vegetation and topography are critical to consider in snow ecohydrological studies in regions with high solar flux and rugged topography.

  abstract = {Characterization of snow is critical for understanding Earth's water and energy cycles. Maps of snow from MODIS have seen growing use in investigations of climate, hydrology, and glaciology, but the lack of rigorous validation of different snow mapping methods compromises these studies. We examine three widely used MODIS snow products: the ``binary'' (i.e., snow yes/no) global snow maps that were among the initial MODIS standard products; a more recent standard MODIS fractional snow product; and another fractional snow product, MODSCAG, based on spectral mixture analysis. We compare them to maps of snow obtained from Landsat ETM+ data, whose 30 m spatial resolution provides nearly 300 samples within a 500 m MODIS nadir pixel. The assessment uses 172 images spanning a range of snow and vegetation conditions, including the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Upper Rio Grande, California's Sierra Nevada, and the Nepal Himalaya. MOD10A1 binary and fractional fail to retrieve snow in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt while MODSCAG consistently maintains its retrieval ability during these periods. Averaged over all regions, the RMSE for MOD10A1 fractional is 0.23, whereas the MODSCAG RMSE is 0.10. MODSCAG performs the most consistently through accumulation, mid-winter and melt, with median differences ranging from \`A0.16 to 0.04 while differences for MOD10A1 fractional range from \`A0.34 to 0.35. MODSCAG maintains its performance over all land cover classes and throughout a larger range of land surface properties. Characterizing snow cover by spectral mixing is more accurate than empirical methods based on the normalized difference snow index, both for identifying where snow is and is not and for estimating the fractional snow cover within a sensor's instantaneous fieldof-view. Determining the fractional value is particularly important during spring and summer melt in mountainous terrain, where large variations in snow, vegetation and soil occur over small distances and when snow can melt rapidly.},

  abstract = {We present the first application of the Snow Covered Area and Grain size model (SCAG) to the Visible Infrared imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and assess these retrievals with finer-resolution fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Because Landsat 8 OLI avoids saturation issues common to Landsat 1\textendash 7 in the visible wavelengths, we re-assess the accuracy of the SCAG fractional snow cover maps from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that were previously evaluated using data from earlier Landsat sensors. Use of the fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8 OLI shows a negative bias of -0.5\% for MODSCAG and -1.3\% for VIIRSCAG, whereas previous MODSCAG evaluations found a bias of -7.6\% in the Himalaya. We find similar root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.133 and 0.125 for MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. The Recall statistic (probability of detection) for cells with more than 15\% snow cover in this challenging steep topography was found to be 0.90 for both MODSCAG and VIIRSCAG, significantly higher than previous evaluations based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). In addition, daily retrievals from MODIS and VIIRS are consistent across gradients of elevation, slope, and aspect. Different native resolutions of the gridded products at 1~km and 500~m for VIIRS and MODIS, respectively, result in snow cover maps showing a slightly different distribution of values with VIIRS having more mixed pixels and MODIS having 7\% more pure snow pixels. Despite the resolution differences, the snow maps from both sensors produce similar total snow-covered areas and snow-line elevations in this region, with               R               2               values of 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. We find that the SCAG algorithm performs consistently across various spatial resolutions and that fractional snow cover maps from the VIIRS instruments aboard Suomi NPP, JPPS\textendash 1, and JPPS\textendash 2 can be a suitable replacement as MODIS sensors reach their ends of life.},

  abstract = {In addition to providing water for nearly 2 billion people, snow drives resource selection by wildlife and in\- fluences the behavior and demography of many species. Because snow cover is highly spatially and temporally variable, mapping its extent using currently available satellite data remains a challenge. At present, there are no sensors acquiring daily data of Earth's entire surface at fine spatial resolutions ({$<$} 30 m) in wavelengths required for snow cover retrieval, namely: visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. Fine scale observations at 30 m from Landsat are available at 16-day intervals since 1982 and at 8-day intervals since 1999. However, over this duration, snow can accumulate, ablate, or both, making the Landsat data ineffective for many applications. Conversely, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospherically corrected daily reflectance data, have a coarse spatial resolution of 463 m and thus, are not ideal for snow cover mapping either. This spatial and temporal resolution tradeoff limits the use of these data for a wide range of snow cover ap\- plications and indicates a pressing need for data fusion. To address this need, we use a physically-based, spectralmixture-analysis approach for mapping fractional snow cover (fSCA) and a two-stage random forest algorithm to produce daily 30 m fSCA. We test our algorithm in the US Sierra Nevada and find MODIS fSCA is the most important predictor. We cross validate using 170 Landsat scenes and while snow cover varies immensely in time we find little variation in errors between seasons, a small bias of 0.01, and an overall accuracy of 0.97 with slightly higher precision than recall. This technique for accurate, daily, high-resolution snow cover retrievals could be applied more broadly for analyses of regional energy budget, validating snow cover in global and regional models, and for quantifying changes in the availability of biotic resources in ecosystems.},

NISAR has completed its preliminary design and successfully passed its Preliminary Design Review in June 2016. This paper describes the radar instrument design, engineering model hardware development status, test results, and the plans for future maturation toward the Critical Design Review in late 2018. NISAR has two radars sharing a mechanical structure and reflector, one operating at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and the other at S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve wide-swath observations at both wavelengths, NISAR is designed as a reflector-feed system where the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive capability. In the partnership, NASA provides the instrument structure for both L- and Sband electronics, the L-band electronics, the reflector and associated boom, and an avionics payload to interface with the radar including a solid-state data recorder, high-rate Ka-band telecommunication link, and a GPS receiver. In addition to providing the spacecraft and launch vehicle for the mission partnership, ISRO is also providing S-band radar electronics, and an additional high-rate Ka-band telecom package. This paper will describe aspects of this technically and logistically complex international instrument and mission development, one that requires careful definition of interfaces, tracking of resources, joint analysis of designed capabilities, and detailed integration and test plans.},

Differential interferometry can provide key deformation measurements, important for studies of earthquakes, volcanoes and other dynamically changing phenomena. Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system will be able to fly predefined paths with great precision. The expected performance of the flight control system will constrain the flight path to be within a 10 m diameter tube about the desired flight track. The radar will be designed to be operable on a UAV (Unpiloted Arial Vehicle) but will initially be demonstrated on a on a NASA Gulfstream III. The radar will be fully polarimetric, with a range bandwidth of 80 MHz (2 m range resolution), and will support a 16 km range swath. The antenna will be electronically steered along track to assure that the antenna beam can be directed independently, regardless of the wind direction and speed. Other features supported by the antenna include elevation monopulse and pulse-to-pulse re-steering capabilities that will enable some novel modes of operation. The system will nominally operate at 45,000 ft (13800 m). The program began as an Instrument Incubator Project (IIP) funded by NASA Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO).},

Because the SAR signal of ground covered by dry snow is dominated by backscatter from the snow/ground interface, the differential phase shift due to propagation in the snow can be directly related to SWE. The factors of relevance for coherence of snow covered areas were studied by theoretical modeling and analysis of repeat pass SAR data, showing that the C-band coherence often deteriorates rapidly in case of snow fall whereas coherence is much better preserved at L-band. Case studies on SWE retrieval are presented for 3-day repeatpass ERS SAR data of the Austrian Alps and 4-month repeat-pass L-band airborne SAR data of Oberpfaffenhofen. The investigations confirm the potential of repeat-pass InSAR data for mapping SWE with high spatial detail, suggesting clear preference for L-band. For fully assessing the InSAR capabilities for SWE retrieval, dedicated experiments with co-located, spatially detailed field measurements need to be carried out.},

A comprehensive data set of snow microstructure (94 profiles at 36 sites) and snow layer thickness (9000 vertical profiles across nine trenches) collected over two winters at Trail Valley Creek, NWT, Canada, was applied in synthetic radiative transfer experiments. This allowed for robust assessment of the impact of estimation accuracy of unknown snow microstructural characteristics on the viability of SWE retrievals. Depth hoar layer thickness varied over the shortest horizontal distances, controlled by subnivean vegetation and topography, while variability in total snowpack thickness approximated that of wind slab layers. Mean horizontal correlation lengths of layer thickness were less than a metre for all layers. Depth hoar was consistently {$\sim$}30\,\% of total depth, and with increasing total depth the proportion of wind slab increased at the expense of the decreasing surface snow layer. Distinct differences were evident between distributions of layer properties; a single median value represented density and specific surface area (SSA) of each layer well. Spatial variability in microstructure of depth hoar layers dominated SWE retrieval errors. A depth hoar SSA estimate of around 7\,\% under the median value was needed to accurately retrieve SWE. In shallow snowpacks {$<$}0.6\,m, depth hoar SSA estimates of {$\pm$}5\,\%\textendash 10\,\% around the optimal retrieval SSA allowed SWE retrievals within a tolerance of {$\pm$}30\,mm. Where snowpacks were deeper than {$\sim$}30\,cm, accurate values of representative SSA for depth hoar became critical as retrieval errors were exceeded if the median depth hoar SSA was applied.},

Following standard observing protocol, manual measurements of 6-h snowfall and total snow depth on ground were also gathered. Results show that the sensors report the depth of snow directly beneath on average within Ϯ1 cm of manual observations. However, the sensors tended to underestimate the traditional total depth of snow-on-ground measurement by approximately 2 cm. This is mainly attributed to spatial variability of the snow cover caused by factors such as wind scour and wind drift.},

The relationship between snow water equivalence (SWE) and SAR backscattering coefficients at C- and X-band (5.5 and 9.6 GHz) can be either positive or negative. Therefore, discovery of the relationship with an empirical approach is unrealistic. Instead, the authors estimate snow depth and particle size using SIR-C/X-SAR imagery from a physically-based first order backscattering model through analyses of the importance of each scattering term and its sensitivity to snow properties. Using numerically simulated backscattering values, the authors develop semi-empirical models for characterizing the snow-ground interaction terms, the relationships between the ground surface backscattering components, and the snowpack extinction properties at C-band and X-band. With these relationships, snow depth and optical equivalent grain size can be estimated from SIR-C/X-SAR measurements. Validation using three SIR-C/X-SAR images shows that the algorithm performs usefully for incidence angles greater than 300, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 34 cm and 0.27 mm for estimating snow depth and ice optical equivalent particle radius, respectively.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is decreasing seasonal snowpacks globally, with potentially catastrophic consequences on water resources, given the long-h eld reliance on snowpack in water management. In this Review, we examine the changes and trickle-d own impacts of snow loss in the western United States (WUS). Across the WUS, snow water equivalent declines of \textasciitilde 25\% are expected by 2050, with losses comparable with contemporary historical trends. There is less consensus on the time horizon of snow disappearance, but model projections combined with a new low-to-no snow definition suggest \textasciitilde 35\textendash 60 years before low-t o-no snow becomes persistent if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Diminished and more ephemeral snowpacks that melt earlier will alter groundwater and streamflow dynamics. The direction of these changes are difficult to constrain given competing factors such as higher evapotranspiration, altered vegetation co\- m\-pos\- i\-tion and changes in wildfire behaviour in a warmer world. These changes undermine conventional WUS water management practices, but through proactive implementation of soft and hard adaptation strategies, there is potential to build resilience to extreme, episodic and, eventually, persistent low-t o-no snow conditions. Federal investments offer a timely opportunity to address these vulnerabilities, but they require a concerted portfolio of activities that cross historically siloed physical and disciplinary boundaries.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The coherent backscatter opposition effect (CBOE) enhances the backscatter intensity of electromagnetic waves by up to a factor of~2 in a very narrow cone around the direct return direction when multiple scattering occurs in a weakly absorbing, disordered medium. So far, this effect has not been investigated in terrestrial snow in the microwave spectrum. It has also received little attention in scattering models. We present the first characterization of the CBOE in dry snow using ground-based and spaceborne bistatic radar systems. For a seasonal snowpack in the Ku-band (17.2\,GHz), we found backscatter enhancement of 50\,\%\textendash 60\,\% (+1.8\textendash 2.0\,dB) at a zero bistatic angle and a peak half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of 0.25{$\circ$}. In the X-band (9.65\,GHz), we found backscatter enhancement of at least 35\,\% (+1.3\,dB) and an estimated HWHM of 0.12{$\circ$} in the accumulation areas of glaciers in the Jungfrau\textendash Aletsch region, Switzerland. Sampling of the peak shape at different bistatic angles allows estimating the scattering and absorption mean free paths, {$\Lambda$}T and {$\Lambda$}A. In the VV polarization, we obtained {$\Lambda$}T=0.4{$\pm$}0.1\,m and {$\Lambda$}A=19{$\pm$}12\,m at the Ku-band and {$\Lambda$}T=2.1{$\pm$}0.4\,m and {$\Lambda$}A=21.8{$\pm$}2.7\,m at the X-band, assuming an optically thick medium. The HH polarization yielded similar results. The observed backscatter enhancement is thus significant enough to require consideration in backscatter models describing monostatic and bistatic radar experiments. Enhanced backscattering beyond the Earth, on the surface of solar system bodies, has been interpreted as being caused by the presence of water ice. In agreement with this interpretation, our results confirm the presence of the CBOE at X- and Ku-band frequencies in terrestrial snow.},

A shift in the timing of springtime snowmelt towards earlier in the year already is observed during 1948\textendash 2000 in many western rivers. Streamflow timing changes for the 1995\textendash 2099 period are projected using regression relations between observed streamflow-timing responses in each river, measured by the temporal centroid of streamflow (CT) each year, and local temperature (TI) and precipitation (PI) indices. Under 21st century warming trends predicted by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) under business-as-usual greenhouse-gas emissions, streamflow timing trends across much of western North America suggest even earlier springtime snowmelt than observed to date. Projected CT changes are consistent with observed rates and directions of change during the past five decades, and are strongest in the Pacific Northwest, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, where many rivers eventually run 30\textendash 40 days earlier. The modest PI changes projected by PCM yield minimal CT changes. The responses of CT to the simultaneous effects of projected TI and PI trends are dominated by the TI changes. Regressionbased CT projections agree with those from physically-based simulations of rivers in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Snow cover mapping algorithms utilizing multispectral satellite data at various spatial resolutions are available, each treating subpixel variation differently. Past evaluations of snow mapping accuracy typically relied on satellite data collected at a higher spatial resolution than the data in question. However, these optical data cannot characterize snow cover mapping performance under forest canopies or at the meter scale. Here, we use 3\,m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116\,d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat~8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat~8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes. Metrics are calculated at the pixel and basin scales, including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and F statistic (a detection measure). The newer MOD10A1F Version~61 and VNP10A1F Version~1 product biases (-\,7.1\,\%, -9.5\,\%) improve significantly when linear equations developed for older products are applied (2.8\,\%, -2.7\,\%) to convert band ratios to fSCA. The F statistics are unchanged (94.4\,\%, 93.1\,\%) and the VNP10A1F RMSE improves (18.6\,\% to 15.7\,\%), while the MOD10A1F RMSE worsens (12.7\,\% to 13.7\,\%). Consistent with previous studies, spectral-unmixing approaches (SCAG, SPIReS) show lower biases (-0.1\,\%, -0.1\,\%) and RMSE (12.1\,\%, 12.0\,\%), with higher F statistics (95.6\,\%, 96.1\,\%) relative to the band ratio approaches for MODIS. Landsat~8 products are all spectral-mixture methods with low biases (-0.4\,\% to 0.3\,\%), low RMSE (11.4\,\% to 15.8\,\%), and high F statistics (97.3\,\% to 99.1\,\%). Spectral-unmixing methods can improve snow cover mapping at the global scale.},

  abstract = {Spaceborne Interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology used in the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and spaceborne lidar such as Shuttle Laser Altimeter-02 (SLA-02) are two promising technologies for providing global scale digital elevation models (DEMs). Each type of these systems has limitations that affect the accuracy or extent of coverage. These systems are complementary in developing DEM data. In this study, surface height measured independently by SRTM and SLA-02 was cross-validated. SLA data was first verified by field observations, and examinations of individual lidar waveforms. The geolocation accuracy of the SLA height data sets was examined by checking the correlation between the SLA surface height with SRTM height at 90 m resolution, while shifting the SLA ground track within its specified horizontal errors. It was found that the heights from the two instruments were highly correlated along the SLA ground track, and shifting the positions did not improve the correlation significantly. Absolute surface heights from SRTM and SLA referenced to the same horizontal and vertical datum (World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 Ellipsoid) were compared. The effects of forest cover and surface slope on the height difference were also examined. After removing the forest effect on SRTM height, the mean height difference with SLA-02 was near zero. It can be further inferred from the standard deviation of the height differences that the absolute accuracy of SRTM height at low vegetation area is better than the SRTM mission specifications (16 m). The SRTM height bias caused by forest cover needs to be further examined using future spaceborne lidar (e.g. GLAS) data.},

The one-dimensional and mean two-dimensional power spectra of snow depth exhibit power law behavior in two frequency intervals separated by a scale break located between 7 m and 45 m. The spectral exponents for the low-frequency range vary between 0.1 and 1.2 for the one-dimensional spectra, and between 1.3 and 2.2 for the mean two-dimensional power spectra. The spectral exponents for the high-frequency range vary between 3.3 and 3.6 for the one-dimensional spectra, and between 4.0 and 4.5 for the mean two-dimensional spectra. Such spectral exponents indicate the existence of two distinct scaling regimes, with significantly larger variations occurring in the larger-scale regime. Similar bilinear power law spectra were obtained for the fields of vegetation height, with crossover wavelengths between 7 m and 14 m. Further analysis of the snow depth and vegetation fields, together with wind data, support the conclusion that the break in the scaling behavior of snow depth is controlled by the scaling characteristics of the spatial distribution of vegetation height when snow redistribution by wind is minimal and canopy interception is dominant, and by the interaction of winds with features such as surface concavities and vegetation when snow redistribution by wind is dominant.},

  abstract = {The importance of snow cover extent (SCE) has been proven to strongly link with various natural phenomenon and human activities; consequently, monitoring snow cover is one the most critical topics in studying and understanding the cryosphere. As snow cover can vary significantly within short time spans and often extends over vast areas, spaceborne remote sensing constitutes an efficient observation technique to track it continuously. However, as optical imagery is limited by cloud cover and polar darkness, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) attracted more attention for its ability to sense day-and-night under any cloud and weather condition. In addition to widely applied backscattering-based method, thanks to the advancements of spaceborne SAR sensors and image processing techniques, many new approaches based on interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have been developed since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991 to monitor snow cover under both dry and wet snow conditions. Critical auxiliary data including DEM, land cover information, and local meteorological data have also been explored to aid the snow cover analysis. This review presents an overview of existing studies and discusses the advantages, constraints, and trajectories of the current developments.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 \texttimes{} 106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate ({$\sim$} -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.},

The model accounts for surface backscattering contributions by the snow-air and snow-soil interfaces, and for volume backscattering contributions by the snow layer. Through comparisons of backscattering data for different terrain surfaces measured both with and without snowcover, the masking effects of snow are evaluated as a function of snow water equivalent and liquid water content. The results indicate that with dry snowcover it is not possible to discriminate between different types of ground surface (concrete, asphalt, grass, and bare ground) if the snow water equivalent is greater than about 20 cm (or a depth greater than 60 cm for a snow density of 0.3 g {$\cdot$} cm-3). For the same density, however, if the snow is wet, a depth of 10 cm is sufficient to mask the underlying surface.},

  abstract = {Himalayan snow contributes significantly in towards water resource in several countries in Asia. In mountain hydrology, timely information on the spatial and temporal variability of the extent of wet snow is significant in snowmelt runoff models. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled us to study the extent of snow cover using different techniques based on remote sensing data. The all-weather capability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) makes it extremely useful especially in difficult alpine terrains. Due to the penetrability of microwave signals, dry snow often exhibits scattering from the underlying soil surface. Snow exhibits very high reflectance in the visible and near infrared spectrum. Thus, using either optical or active microwave data, identification of wet and dry snow for characterization of snow surface is a complicated problem. This paper investigates the potential of optical and SAR imagery for identification of dry and wet snow in alpine regions by considering a synergistic multi-sensor framework. In this study, the wet snow is identified using Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and simultaneously the dry snow is determined using Landsat-8 multispectral data. The study is conducted around a glacier area in Sarsot near Gulmarg in Jammu and Kashmir, India.},

In other regions of the world that depend on snowmelt for water resources, snow data can be scarce, and these regions are vulnerable to drought or flood conditions. Even in the U.S., water resource management is hampered by limited snow data in certain regions, as evident by the 2011 Missouri Basin flooding due in large part to the significant Plains snowpack. Satellite data could potentially provide important information in under-sampled areas. This study compared the daily AMSR-E and SSM/I SWE products over nine winter seasons to spatially distributed, modeled output SNODAS summed over 2100 watersheds in the conterminous U.S. Results show large areas where the passive microwave retrievals are highly correlated to the SNODAS data, particularly in the northern Great Plains and southern Rocky Mountain regions. However, the passive microwave SWE is significantly lower than SNODAS in heavily forested areas, and regions that typically receive a deep snowpack. The best correlations are associated with basins in which maximum annual SWE is less than 200 mm, and forest fraction is less than 20\%. Even in many watersheds with poor correlations between the passive microwave data and SNODAS maximum annual SWE values, the overall pattern of accumulation and ablation did show good agreement and therefore may provide useful hydrologic information on melt timing and season length.},

An important consideration for water resources planning is runoff timing, which can be strongly influenced by the physical process of water storage within and release from seasonal snowpacks. The aim of this study is to present a novel method that combines light detection and ranging with ground-penetrating radar to nondestructively estimate the spatial distribution of bulk liquid water content in a seasonal snowpack during spring snowmelt. We develop these methods in a manner to be applicable within a short time window, making it possible to spatially observe rapid changes that occur to this property at subdaily timescales. We applied these methods at two experimental plots in Colorado, showing the high variability of liquid water content in snow. Volumetric liquid water contents ranged from near zero to 19\%vol within the scale of meters. We also show rapid changes in bulk liquid water content of up to 5\%vol that occur over subdaily timescales. The presented methods have an average uncertainty in bulk liquid water content of 1.5\%vol, making them applicable for future studies to estimate the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of liquid water in snow.},

  abstract = {Extensive efforts have been made to observe the accumulation and melting of seasonal snow. However, making accurate observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at global scales is challenging. Active radar systems show promise, provided the dielectric properties of the snowpack are accurately constrained. The dielectric constant (k) determines the velocity of a radar wave through snow, which is a critical component of time-of-flight radar techniques such as ground penetrating radar and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). However, equations used to estimate k have been validated only for specific conditions with limited in situ validation for seasonal snow applications. The goal of this work was to further understand the dielectric permittivity of seasonal snow under both dry and wet conditions. We utilized extensive direct field observations of k, along with corresponding snow density and liquid water content (LWC) measurements. Data were collected in the Jemez Mountains, NM; Sandia Mountains, NM; Grand Mesa, CO; and Cameron Pass, CO from February 2020 to May 2021. We present empirical relationships based on 146 snow pits for dry snow conditions and 92 independent LWC observations in naturally melting snowpacks. Regression results had r2 values of 0.57 and 0.37 for dry and wet snow conditions, respectively. Our results in dry snow showed large differences between our in situ observations and commonly applied equations. We attribute these differences to assumptions in the shape of the snow grains that may not hold true for seasonal snow applications. Different assumptions, and thus different equations, may be necessary for varying snowpack conditions in different climates, suggesting that further testing is necessary. When considering wet snow, large differences were found between commonly applied equations and our in situ measurements. Many previous equations assume a background (dry snow) k that we found to be inaccurate, as previously stated, and is the primary driver of resulting uncertainty. Our results suggest large errors in SWE (10\textendash 15\%) or LWC (0.05\textendash 0.07 volumetric LWC) estimates based on current equations. The work presented here could prove useful for making accurate observations of changes in SWE using future InSAR opportunities such as NISAR and ROSE-L.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Modeling the multidimensional flow of liquid water through snow has been limited in spatial and temporal scales to date. Here, we present simulations using the inverse TOUGH2 (iTOUGH2) model informed by the model SNOWPACK, referred to as SnowTOUGH. We use SnowTOUGH to simulate snow metamorphism, melt/freeze processes, and liquid water movement in two-dimensional snowpacks at the plot scale (20\,m) on a sloping ground surface during multi-day observation periods at three field sites in northern Colorado, USA. Model results compare well with sites below the treeline and above the treeline but not at a site near the treeline. Results show the importance of longitudinal intra-snowpack flow paths (i.e., parallel to ground surface in the downslope direction and sometimes referred to as lateral flow), particularly during times when the snow surface (i.e., snow\textendash atmosphere interface) is not actively melting. At our above-treeline site, simulations show that longitudinal flow can occur at rates orders of magnitude greater than vertically downward percolating water flow at a mean ratio of 75:1 as a result of hydraulic barriers that divert flow. Our near-treeline site simulations resulted in slightly less longitudinal flow than vertically percolating water, and the below-treeline site resulted in negligible longitudinal flow of liquid water. These results show the increasing influence of longitudinal intra-snowpack flow paths with elevation, similar to field observations. Results of this study suggest that intra-snowpack longitudinal flow may be an important process for consideration in hydrologic modeling for higher-elevation headwater catchments.},

  abstract = {Snow is an important environmental variable in headwater systems that controls hydrological processes such as streamflow, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration. These processes will be affected by both the amount of snow available for melt and the rate at which it melts. Snow water equivalent (SWE) and snowmelt are known to vary within complex subalpine terrain due to terrain and canopy influences. This study assesses this variability during the melt season using ground penetrating radar to survey multiple plots in northwestern Colorado near a snow telemetry (SNOTEL) station. The plots include south aspect and flat aspect slopes with open, coniferous (subalpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa and engelman spruce, Picea engelmanii), and deciduous (aspen, populous tremuooides) canopy cover. Results show the high variability for both SWE and loss of SWE during spring snowmelt in 2014. The coefficient of variation for SWE tended to increase with time during snowmelt whereas loss of SWE remained similar. Correlation lengths for SWE were between two and five meters with melt having correlation lengths between two and four meters. The SNOTEL station regularly measured higher SWE values relative to the survey plots but was able to reasonably capture the overall mean loss of SWE during melt. Ground Penetrating Radar methods can improve future investigations with the advantage of non-destructive sampling and the ability to estimate depth, density, and SWE.},

The data showed the response of the Ku-band radar echoes to snowpack changes for various types of background vegetation in the study site in north central Colorado. We observed about 0.15-0.5-dB increases in backscatter for every 1 cm of snow-water-equivalent (SWE) accumulation for areas with short vegetation (sagebrush and pasture). The region with the smaller amount of biomass, signified by the backscatter in November, seemed to have the stronger backscatter response to SWE in decibels. The data also showed the impact of surface hoar growth and freeze/thaw cycles, which created large snow-grain sizes, ice crust layers, and ice lenses and consequently increased the radar signals by a few decibels. The copolarized HH/VV backscatter ratio seems to indicate double-bounce scattering between the ground surface and snow or vegetation. The cross-polarized backscatter [vertical-horizontal (VH)] showed not only the influence of vegetation but also the strong response to snow accumulation. The observed HV/VV ratio suggests the importance of multiple scattering or nonspherical scattering geometry of snow grain in the dense-media radiative transfer scattering model. Comparison of the POLSCAT and QuikSCAT data was made and confirmed the effects of mixed terrain covers in the coarse-resolution QuikSCAT data.},

The design focuses on the forward-looking geometry near the specular direction, which allows a high surface reflectivity, in order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a moderate receiving antenna gain. The sparse array is utilized to sharpen the across-track resolution and reduce the iso-range ambiguity. The formulation for match filtering and illustrations of point target response are presented. This work shows that an array of five to seven receivers is able to achieve an across-track resolution of about 200 m in the outer portion of swath and about 1 km in the center part of swath. The along-track resolution can reach 10 m or better due to the feasibility of a long dwell time for Doppler filtering. We find that the sparse array allows the reduction of the iso-range ambiguity to a level of lower than 5\% for a major portion of swath, 70\% or greater depending on the number of receivers and spacing. We have completed an SNR formulation, which can consistently account for both coherent and incoherent scattering regardless the spatial resolution. An analysis of SNR based on the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering has been performed. We find that it is possible to obtain a swath width of 100 km with an SNR of 5 dB or better for a constellation of seven satellites with a receiving antenna directivity of 15 dBi at a LEO altitude of 675 km for a wide range of surface roughness. Our study suggests the promise of the SoOpSAR concept for high-resolution remote sensing of land surfaces.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric effects represent one of the major error sources of repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and could mask actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. The tropospheric delays vary both vertically and laterally and can be considered as the sum of (i) a vertically stratified component highly correlated with topography and (ii) a turbulent component resulting from turbulent processes in the troposphere varying both in space and time. In this paper, we outline a framework to routinely use pointwise GPS data to reduce tropospheric effects on satellite radar measurements. An Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition (ITD) model is used and further developed to separate tropospheric stratified and turbulent signals and then generate high-resolution correction maps for SAR interferograms. Cross validation is employed to assess the performance of the ITD model and act as an indicator to users of when and where correction is feasible. Tests were carried out to assess the impact of GPS station spacing on the ITD model InSAR correction performance, which provides insights into the trade-off between station spacing and the achievable accuracy. The application of this framework to Sentinel-1A interferograms over the Southern California (USA) and Southern England (UK) regions shows approximately 45\textendash 78\% of noise reduction even with a sparse (\textasciitilde{} 50\textendash 80 km station spacing) GPS network and/or with strong and non-random tropospheric turbulence. This is about a 50\% greater improvement than previous methods. It is believed that this framework could lead to a generic InSAR atmospheric correction model while incorporating continuous and global tropospheric delay datasets, e.g. numerical weather models.},

Spatial and temporal changes of 20\% in relative humidity lead to 10 cm errors in deformation products, and perhaps 100 m of error in derived topographic maps for those pass pairs with unfavorable baseline geometries. In wet regions such as Hawaii, these are by far the dominant errors in the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X Band Synthetic Aperature Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) interferometric products. The unknown time delay from tropospheric distortion is independent of frequency, and thus multiwavelength measurements, such as those commonly used to correct radar altimeter and Global Positioning System (GPS) ionospheric biases, cannot be used to rectify the error. In the topographic case, the errors may be mitigated by choosing interferometric pairs with relatively long baselines, as the error amplitude is inversely proportional to the perpendicular component of the interferometer baseline. For the SIR-C/X-SAR Hawaii data we found that the best (longest) baseline pair produced a map supporting 100 m contouring, whereas the poorest baseline choice yielded an extremely noisy topographic map even at this coarse contour interval. In the case of deformation map errors the result is either independent of baseline parameters or else very nearly so. Here the only solution is averaging of independent interferograms, so in order to create accurate deformation products in wet regions many multiple passes may be required. Rules for designing optimal data acquisition and processing sequences for interferometric analyses in nondesert parts of the world are (1) to use the longest radar wavelengths possible, within ionospheric scintillation and Faraday rotation limits, (2) for topography, maximize interferometer baseline within decorrelation limits* and (3) for surface deformation, use multiple observations and average the derived products. Following the above recipe yields accuracies of 10 m for digital elevation models and 1 cm for deformation maps even in very wet regions, such as Hawaii.},

  abstract = {A radar interferometric technique for topographic mapping of surfaces promises a high resolution, globally consistent approach to generation of digital elevation models. One implementation approach, that of utilizing a single synthetic aperture radar system in a nearly repeating orbit, is attractive not only for cost and complexity reasons but also in that it permits inference of changes in the surface over the orbit repeat cycle from the correlation properties of the radar echoes. Here we characterize the various sources contributing to the echo correlation statistics, and isolate the term which most closely describes sur cial change. We then examine the application of this approach to topographic mapping of vegetated surfaces which may be expected to possess varying backscatter over time. We nd that there is decorrelation increasing with time but that digital terrain model generation remains feasible. We present such a map of a forested area in Oregon which also includes some nearly unvegetated lava ows, and nd that temporal decorrelation contributions to the height errors may be limited to 1.5 and 2.6 m for the forested and lava areas, respectively, if suitable attention is given to experiment design. Such a technique could provide a global digital terrain map.},

  abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations provide a means for obtaining high-resolution topographic terrain maps from data acquired simultaneously at two slightly displaced antennas. Calculation of the three-dimensional coordinates of all the points in a radar image can be made from the combination of along-track, slant range, and interferometer fringe measurements. Thus the result compensates for the layover exhibited by conventional radar maps and removes the false targets generated by multiple signal paths to a given object in the scene. We have derived a topographic map of a portion of the San Francisco Bay Area utilizing data that were recorded by a radar system mounted on a NASA CV990 aircraft and processed by a general purpose digital computer. This map displays the height above sea level of a region approximately 11 km by 10 km in size, sampled on an 11-m pixel grid. Uncertainties in the estimated height result from imprecise knowledge of the observational geometry, radar bandwidth limitations, and finite signal-to-noise ratios. For our system, each factor contributed approximately 3\textendash 4 m to a relative rms error of about 6 m. Additional global errors of the order of 10 m can result from inaccurate monitoring of aircraft attitude. The statistical variation of the height measurements from the ocean portion of the map, which we can presume to be quite flat, is 2\textendash 10 m rms, which is consistent with the theoretical estimate. Comparison of our results with U.S. Geological Survey contour maps indicates a high degree of correlation between the two sets of altitude data.},

  abstract = {This paper implements a newly developed combined active and passive algorithm for the retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) by using three-channel active and two-channel passive observations. First, passive microwave observations at 19 and 37 GHz are used to determine the scattering albedo of snow. An a priori scattering albedo is obtained by averaging over time series observations. Second, 13.3 GHz is introduced to formulate a three-channel (9.6, 13.3, and 17.2 GHz) radar algorithm which reduces effects of background scattering from the snow-soil interface, and improves SWE retrieval. In the algorithm, the bicontinuous dense media radiative transfer (DMRT-Bic) is used to compute look-up tables (LUTs) of both radar backscatter and radiometer brightness temperatures (TBs) of the snowpack. To accelerate the retrieval, a parameterized model is derived from LUT by regression training, which links backscatter to the scattering albedo at 9.6 GHz or 13.3 GHz and to SWE. The volume scattering of snow is obtained by subtracting the background scattering from radar observations. SWE is then retrieved through a cost function that is guided by the a priori scattering albedo obtained from the passive microwave observations. The proposed algorithm, along with the active-only version, is evaluated against the Finnish Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx) data set measured in 2009\textendash 2013. The combined active-passive algorithm achieves root mean square errors (RSME) less than 27 mm and correlation coefficients above 0.68 for 2009\textendash 2010, RMSE less than 21 mm and correlation above 0.85 for 2010\textendash 2011, and RMSE less than 40 mm and correlation above 0.38 for 2012\textendash 2013.},
