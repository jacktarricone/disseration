  abstract = {The seasonal snow-cover is one of the most rapidly varying natural surface features on Earth. It strongly modulates the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon balance. Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit: the operational land imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua. We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes: thresholding of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), regression on the NDSI, and spectral unmixing. We conduct the evaluation at a high-Arctic site in Svalbard, Norway, by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high-resolution snow-cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system. For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals, the regression-based retrievals outperformed the unmixingbased retrievals for all metrics but the bias. For the higher resolution sensors (OLI and MSI), retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board. We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI.},

  abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000\textendash 2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({$>$}1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984\textendash 2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

The impacts of these changes, which include dramatic ice loss from ice sheets and rapid declines in Arctic sea ice, could be quite large in terms of sea level rise and global climate. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), currently planned for launch in 2015, is specifically intended to quantify the amount of change in ice sheets and sea ice and provide key insights into their behavior. It will achieve these objectives through the use of precise laser measurements of surface elevation, building on the groundbreaking capabilities of its predecessor, the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In particular, ICESat-2 will measure the temporal and spatial character of ice sheet elevation change to enable assessment of ice sheet mass balance and examination of the underlying mechanisms that control it. The precision of ICESat-2's elevation measurement will also allow for accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard height, from which sea ice thickness and its temporal changes can be estimated. ICESat-2 will provide important information on other components of the Earth System as well, most notably large-scale vegetation biomass estimates through the measurement of vegetation canopy height. When combined with the original ICESat observations, ICESat-2 will provide ice change measurements across more than a 15-year time span. Its significantly improved laser system will also provide observations with much greater spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy than has ever been possible before.},

  abstract = {High Mountain Asia (HMA) has the largest expanse of snow outside of the polar regions and it plays a critical role in climate and hydrology. In situ monitoring is rare due to terrain complexity and inaccessibility, making remote sensing the most practical way to understand snow patterns in HMA despite relatively short periods of record. Here, trends in snow cover duration were assessed using MODIS between 2002 and 2017 across the headwaters of the region's primary river basins (Amu Darya, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, and Syr Darya). Data limitations, associated with traditional binary mapping and data gaps due to clouds, were addressed with a daily, spatially and temporally complete, snow cover product that maps the fraction of snow in each pixel using spectral mixture analysis. Trends in fractional snow cover duration (fSCD) were calculated at the annual and monthly scale, and across 1,000~m elevation bands, and compared to trends in binary snow cover duration (SCD). Snow cover is present, on average, for 102~days across all basin headwaters, with the longest duration in western basins and shortest in eastern basins. Broadly, snow cover is in decline, which is most pronounced in elevation bands where snow is most likely to be present and most needed to sustain glaciers. Some of the strongest negative trends in fSCD were in the Syr Darya, which has 13 fewer days between 4,000\textendash 5,000~m, and Brahmaputra, which has 31 fewer days between 5,000\textendash 6,000~m. The only increasing tendency was found in the Indus between 2,000 and 5,000~m. There were differences between fSCD and SCD trends, due to SCD overestimating snow cover area relative to fSCD.},

  abstract = {Remote measurements of the fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil are critical to understanding climate and land-use controls over the functional properties of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Spectral mixture analysis is a method employed to estimate PV, NPV and bare soil extent from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery. To date, no studies have systematically compared multispectral and hyperspectral sampling schemes for quantifying PV, NPV and bare soil covers using spectral mixture models. We tested the accuracy and precision of spectral mixture analysis in arid shrubland and grassland sites of the Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico, USA using the NASA Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). A general, probabilistic spectral mixture model, Auto-MCU, was developed that allows for automated sub-pixel cover analysis using any number or combination of optical wavelength samples. The model was tested with five different hyperspectral sampling schemes available from the AVIRIS data as well as with data convolved to Landsat TM, Terra MODIS, and Terra ASTER optical channels. Full-range (0.4-2.5 w m) sampling strategies using the most common hyperspectral or multispectral channels consistently over-estimated bare soil extent and under-estimated PV cover in our shrubland and grassland sites. This was due to bright soil reflectance relative to PV reflectance in visible, near-IR, and shortwave-IR channels. However, by utilizing the shortwave-IR2 region (SWIR2; 2.0-2.3 w m) with a procedure that normalizes all reflectance values to 2.03 w m, the sub-pixel fractional covers of PV, NPV and bare soil constituents were accurately estimated. AVIRIS is one of the few sensors that can provide the spectral coverage and signal-to-noise ratio in the SWIR2 to carry out this particular analysis. ASTER, with its 5-channel SWIR2 sampling, provides some means for isolating bare soil fractional cover within image pixels, but additional studies are needed to verify the results.}

  abstract = {The detection of building footprints and road networks has many useful applications including the monitoring of urban development, real-time navigation, etc. Taking into account that a great deal of human attention is required by these remote sensing tasks, a lot of effort has been made to automate them. However, the vast majority of the approaches rely on very high-resolution satellite imagery ({$<$}2.5 m) whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. Working with the limited spatial resolution provided by high-resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) makes it hard to detect buildings and roads, since these labels may coexist within the same pixel. This paper focuses on this problem and presents a novel methodology capable of detecting building and roads with sub-pixel width by increasing the resolution of the output masks. This methodology consists of fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (at 10 m) together with OpenStreetMap to train deep learning models for building and road detection at 2.5 m. This becomes possible thanks to the usage of OpenStreetMap vector data, which can be rasterized to any desired resolution. Accordingly, a few simple yet effective modifications of the U-Net architecture are proposed to not only semantically segment the input image, but also to learn how to enhance the resolution of the output masks. As a result, generated mappings quadruplicate the input spatial resolution, closing the gap between satellite and aerial imagery for building and road detection. To properly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, a data-set composed of 44 cities across the Spanish territory have been considered and divided into training and testing cities. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for sub-pixel width building and road detection following the proper methodology.},

  abstract = {Snow albedo is a dominant control on snowmelt in many parts of the world. An empirical albedo decay equation, developed over 60 years ago, is still used in snowmelt models. Several empirical snow albedo models developed since show wide spread in results. Remotely sensed snow albedos have been used in a few studies, but validations are scarce because of the difficulty in making accurate in situ measurements. Reconstruction of snow water equivalent (SWE), where the snowpack is built in reverse, is especially sensitive to albedo. We present two new contributions: (1) an updated albedo model where grain size and light absorbing particle content are solved for simultaneously and (2) multiyear comparisons of remotely sensed and in situ albedo measurements from three high-altitude sites in the western United States. Our remotely sensed albedos show 4 to 6\% RMSE and negligible bias. In comparison, empirical albedo decay models, which require extensive in situ measurements, show RMSE values of 7 to 17\% with biases of -6 to -14\%. We examine the sensitivity of SWE reconstructions to albedo error at two sites. With no simulated error in albedo, reconstructed SWE had MAE values of 7 to 13\% and 5\textendash 6\% bias. The accuracy actually improved with some simulated added error, likely because of a fundamental bias in the reconstruction approach. Conversely, the best age-based decay model showed an 18\textendash 20\% MAE and bias in reconstructed SWE. We conclude that remotely sensed albedos where available are superior to age-based approaches in all aspects except simplicity.},

Using multiple spectral bands rather than band ratios or band indices, retrievals of snow properties that affect its albedo lead to more accurate estimates than widely used age-based models of albedo evolution. Nevertheless, there is substantial room for improvement. We present the Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS) approach, offering the following improvements: 1) Solutions for grain size and concentrations of light absorbing particles are computed simultaneously; 2) Only snow and snow-free endmembers are employed; 3) Cloud-masking and smoothing are integrated; 4) Similar spectra are grouped together and interpolants are used to reduce computation time. The source codes are available in an open repository. Computation is fast enough that users can process imagery on demand. Validation of retrievals from Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) against WorldView-2/3 and the Airborne Snow Observatory shows accurate detection of snow and estimates of fractional snow cover. Validation of albedo shows low errors using terrain-corrected in situ measurements. We conclude by discussing the applicability of this approach to any airborne or spaceborne multispectral sensor and options to further improve retrievals.},

However, reconstructed SWE estimates are available only retrospectively; they do not provide a forecast. To estimate SWE throughout the snowmelt season, we consider physiographic and remotely sensed information as predictors and reconstructed SWE as the target. The period of analysis matches the AMSR-E radiometer's lifetime from 2003 to 2011, for the months of April through June. The spatial resolution of the predictions is 3.125 km, to match the resolution of a microwave brightness temperature product. Two machine learning techniques \textendash{} bagged regression trees and feed-forward neural networks \textendash{} produced similar mean results, with 0\textendash 14 \% bias and 46\textendash 48 mm RMSE on average. Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiencies averaged 0.68 for all years. Daily SWE climatology and fractional snow-covered area are the most important predictors. We conclude that these methods can accurately estimate SWE during the snow season in remote mountains, and thereby provide an independent estimate to forecast runoff and validate other methods to assess the snow resource.},

We propose and evaluate a new method for identifying seasonal snow cover phase changes in the Argentinean Andes using time series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data available in the Google Earth Engine platform. We used meteorological and optical Sentinel-2 data to validate snow presence. Firstly, we investigated seasonal snow cover dynamics in different regions of interest (ROIs). We identified three land surface cover periods: bare soil, dry snow, and melting snow. This finding is significant because other studies show that bare soil and dry snow have similar backscattering responses in C-band. Our methodology uses time series derivatives and their positive and negative anomalies. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with a fixed threshold change detection approach. Our method was able to detect the phase change between bare soil and dry snow period in 75\% of the ROIs, while a fixed threshold of -2dB only detects it in 42\% of the cases. Furthermore, the derivative method also detects in 92\% of the ROIs time series the beginning of the melting period, showing that it is a promising methodology for operative systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding seasonal snow cover dynamics is critical for management of hydrological regimes, habitat availability for wildlife species, forest fire risk assessment and recreational demands. Although data products provided at 500 m spatial resolution by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor provide important and readily available information on snow cover, capturing snow dynamics at finer spatial resolutions remains problematic due to the lack of high temporal and spatial resolution data, which limits the number of available observations each year. In this paper we present a new approach to create a daily time-series of 30-m snow observations (called SNOWARP), derived from daily MODIS Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover data to capture the temporal dynamics of snow cover and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to re-order historical Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations to account for inter-annual variability. The SNOWARP product was produced for 2000\textendash 2018 for an area of Western Alberta (approximately 30,000 km2) and was calibrated against a network of time-lapse cameras and snow pillows. Results indicate the RMSE of the SNOWARP fractional product ranges from 31.3\%\textendash 68.3\%, while F score of the SNOWARP binary product ranges from 87.7\% - 98.6\% when compared to ground truth data. Capturing fractional snow cover at a fine spatial and temporal scale is important due to the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover, particularly in mountainous regions with implications for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. SNOWARP demonstrates a novel method to increasing the temporal resolution of Landsat-derived snow cover data, providing valuable insights on regional snow cover dynamics for use in a range of applications.},

Monitoring regional and global snow cover has increased in urgency in recent years due to warming temperatures and declines in snow cover extent. Optical satellite instruments provide large-scale observations of snow cover, but cloud cover and dense forest canopy can reduce accuracy in mapping snow cover. Remote camera networks deployed for wildlife monitoring operate below cloud cover and in forests, representing a virtually untapped source of snow cover observations to supplement satellite observations. Using images from 1181 wildlife cameras deployed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), we compared snow cover extracted from camera images to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products during winter months of 2018\textendash 2020. Ordinal snow classifications (scale~=~0\textendash 4) from cameras were closely related to normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values from the MODIS Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500~m (MOD10A1) Collection 6 product (R2~=~0.70). Tree canopy cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and image color mode influenced agreement between camera images and MOD10A1 NDSI values. For MOD10A1F, MOD10A1's corresponding cloud-gap filled product, agreement with cloud-gap filled values decreased from 78.5\% to 56.4\% in the first three days of cloudy periods and stabilized thereafter. Using our camera data as validation, we derived a threshold to create daily binary maps of snow cover from the MOD10A1 product. The threshold corresponding to snow presence was an NDSI value of 40.50, which closely matched a previously defined global binary threshold of 40 using the MOD10A2 8-day product. These analyses demonstrate the utility of camera trap networks for validation of snow cover products from satellite remote sensing, as well as their potential to identify sources of inaccuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the use of field data on the spatial variability of snow water equivalent (SWE) to guide the design of distributed snow models. An extensive reanalysis of results from previous field studies in different snow environments around the world is presented, followed by an analysis of field data on spatial variability of snow collected in the headwaters of the Jollie River basin, a rugged mountain catchment in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. In addition, area-averaged simulations of SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Spatial variability at the watershed-scale is shaped by variability in near-surface meteorological fields (e.g., elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope-scale is governed by processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve explicitly. Subgrid probability distributions are often capable of representing the aggregate-impact of unresolved processes at the hillslope-scale, though they may not adequately capture the effects of elevation gradients. While the best modeling strategy is case-specific, the analysis in this paper provides guidance on both the suitability of several common snow modeling approaches and on the choice of parameter values in subgrid probability distributions.},

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10\,m, 20\,m and 60\,m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30\,m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30\,m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35\,million\,km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11\%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90\% for the HLS product are 6.2\,m and 18.8\,m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.},

  abstract = {Laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote-sensing technology that holds tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and avalanche applications. Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate knowledge of snow depth distributions in mountain catchments is critical for applications in hydrology and ecology. Recently, a method was proposed to map snow depth at meter-scale resolution from very-high-resolution stereo satellite imagery (e.g., Pl\'eiades) with an accuracy close to 0.5\,m. However, the validation was limited to probe measurements and unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, which sampled a limited fraction of the topographic and snow depth variability. We improve upon this evaluation using accurate maps of the snow depth derived from Airborne Snow Observatory laser-scanning measurements in the Tuolumne river basin, USA. We find a good agreement between both datasets over a snow-covered area of 138\,km2 on a 3\,m grid, with a positive bias for a Pl\'eiades snow depth of 0.08\,m, a root mean square error of 0.80\,m and a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of 0.69\,m. Satellite data capture the relationship between snow depth and elevation at the catchment scale and also small-scale features like snow drifts and avalanche deposits at a typical scale of tens of meters. The random error at the pixel level is lower in snow-free areas than in snow-covered areas, but it is reduced by a factor of 2 (NMAD of approximately 0.40\,m for snow depth) when averaged to a 36\,m grid. We conclude that satellite photogrammetry stands out as a convenient method to estimate the spatial distribution of snow depth in high mountain catchments.},

  abstract = {Forests cover almost 40\% of the seasonally snow-covered regions in North America. However, operational snow networks are located primarily in forest clearings, and optical remote sensing cannot see through tree canopies to detect forest snowpack. Due to the complex influence of the forest on snowpack duration, ground observations in forests are essential. We therefore consider the effectiveness of different strategies to observe snow-covered area under forests. At our study location in the Pacific Northwest, we simultaneously deployed fiber-optic cable, stand-alone ground temperature sensors, and time-lapse digital cameras in three diverse forest treatments: control second-growth forest, thinned forest, and forest gaps (one tree height in diameter). We derived fractional snow-covered area and snow duration metrics from the colocated instruments to assess optimal spatial resolution and sampling configuration, and snow duration differences between forest treatments. The fiber-optic cable and the cameras indicated that mean snow duration was 8 days longer in the gap plots than in the control plots (p {$<$} 0.001). We conducted Monte Carlo experiments for observing mean snow duration in a 40 m forest plot, and found the 95\% confidence interval was {$\pm$}5 days for 10 m spacing between instruments and {$\pm$}3 days for 6 m spacing. We further tested the representativeness of sampling one plot per treatment group by observing snow duration across replicated forest plots at the same elevation, and at a set of forest plots 250 m higher. Relative relationships between snow duration in the forest treatments are consistent between replicated plots, elevation, and two winters of data.},

  abstract = {Understanding and quantifying satellite-based remotely sensed snow cover errors are critical for successful utilization of snow cover products. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Covered Area (SCA) product errors have been previously recognized to be associated with factors such as cloud contamination, snow pack particles, vegetation cover, and topography; however, the quantitative relationship between the retrieval errors and these factors remains elusive. Joint analysis of MODIS SCA and land surface temperature (LST) products, and in-situ air temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements provides a unique look at the error structure of the recently developed MODIS SCA products. Analysis of the MODIS SCA data set over the period from 2000 to 2005 was undertaken for the California/Nevada and Colorado regions of the western United States. Both regions have extensive observational networks. For this study area, the MODIS SCA product demonstrates strong ability in detecting the presence of snow cover (80\%). However, significant spatial and temporal variations in accuracy (from 75\% in high roughness to 86\% in low roughness regions and 45\% in October to 94\% in February) suggest that a proxy is required to adequately predict the MODIS SCA product errors. For the first time, we demonstrate a relationship between the errors in the MODIS SCA products and temperature in the western United States, and find that this relationship is well-represented by the cumulative double exponential distribution function. We have performed a fitting and validation experiment by deriving the relationship between temperature and the errors in the MODIS SCA product from 2000-2004 period and using 2005 to independently test our method. This relationship is shown to hold for both in-situ daily mean air temperature and MODIS LST. Both of them are useful indices in quantifying the errors in MODIS product for various hydrological applications.},

  abstract = {Estimating the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountainous terrain is currently the most important unsolved problem in snow hydrology. Several methods can estimate the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty related to extrapolation to unrepresented locations. (2) The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at 1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the right answer remains elusive. Good characterization of the snow is necessary to make informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability.

Rather than make users interpolate and filter these patchy daily maps without completely understanding the retrieval algorithm and instrument properties, we use the daily time series to improve the estimate of the measured snow properties for a particular day. We use a combination of noise filtering, snow/cloud discrimination, and interpolation and smoothing to produce our best estimate of the daily snow cover and albedo. We consider two modes: one is the ``predictive'' mode, whereby we estimate the snow-covered area and albedo on that day using only the data up to that day; the other is the ``retrospective'' mode, whereby we reconstruct the history of the snow properties for a previous period.},

Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6\textdegree{} N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25~\hspace{0pt}m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

Research papers reviewed herein largely describe application of AVHRR data for North America, Sahelian Africa and tropical forests of both Africa and South America. All 5 AVHRR bands have found some level of use for land-cover studies. However, the majority of the land characterization research papers used AVHRR/ NDVI as the main data source. Multi-temporal NDVI datasets have found wide use to describe vegetation phenology. AVHRR thermal bands have also been employed by a number of researchers for both surface temperature mapping and for land-cover discrimination especially in tropical rain forests. The most common data analysis techniques employed in these papers were regressions between bands and supervised classification procedures. The review indicated that land-cover mapping and direct estimation of land-cover parameters using AVHRR data is still at an early stage of development. Applications of AVHRR data for these purposes, however, are likely to increase with the availability of I km standard products.}

  abstract = {Seasonal snow melt dominates the hydrologic budget across a large portion of the globe. Snow accumulation and melt vary over a broad range of spatial scales, preventing accurate extrapolation of sparse in situ observations to watershed scales. The lidar onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) was designed for precise mapping of ice sheets and sea ice, and here we assess the feasibility of snow depth-mapping using ICESat2 data in more complex and rugged mountain landscapes. We explore the utility of ATL08 Land and Vegetation Height and ATL06 Land Ice Height differencing from reference elevation datasets in two end member study sites. We analyze \textasciitilde 3 years of data for Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho's Owyhee Mountains and Wolverine Glacier in southcentral Alaska's Kenai Mountains. Our analysis reveals decimeter-scale uncertainties in derived snow depth and glacier mass balance at the watershed scale. Both accuracy and precision decrease as slope increases: the magnitudes of the median and median of the absolute deviation of elevation errors (MAD) vary from \textasciitilde 0.2 m for slopes {$<$}5{$\smwhtcircle$} to {$>$}1 m for slopes {$>$}20{$\smwhtcircle$}. For glacierized regions, failure to account for intraand inter-annual evolution of glacier surface elevations can strongly bias ATL06 elevations, resulting in underestimation of the mass balance gradient with elevation. Based on these results, we conclude that ATL08 and ATL06 observations are best suited for characterization of watershed-scale snow depth and mass balance gra\- dients over relatively shallow slopes with thick snowpacks. In these regions, ICESat-2 elevation residual-derived snow depth and mass balance transects can provide valuable watershed scale constraints on terrain parameterand model-derived estimates of snow accumulation and melt.},

  abstract = {Because of its location, Canada is particularly affected by snow processes and their impact on the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Yet, snow mass observations that are ongoing, global, frequent (1\textendash 5 days), and at high enough spatial resolution (kilometer scale) for assimilation within operational prediction systems are presently not available. Recently, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) partnered with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to initiate a radar-focused snow mission concept study to define spaceborne technological solutions to this observational gap. In this context, an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) was performed to determine the impact of sensor configuration, snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval performance, and snow wet/dry state on snow analyses from the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS). The synthetic experiment shows that snow analyses are strongly sensitive to revisit frequency since more frequent assimilation leads to a more constrained land surface model. The greatest reduction in spatial (temporal) bias is from a 1-day revisit frequency with a 91\% (93\%) improvement. Temporal standard deviation of the error (STDE) is mostly reduced by a greater retrieval accuracy with a 65\% improvement, while a 1-day revisit reduces the temporal STDE by 66\%. The inability to detect SWE under wet snow conditions is particularly impactful during the spring meltdown, with an increase in spatial RMSE of up to 50 mm. Wet snow does not affect the domain-wide annual maximum SWE nor the timing of end-of-season snowmelt timing in this case, indicating that radar measurements, although uncertain during melting events, are very useful in adding skill to snow analyses.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The seasonal snow in the Pyrenees is critical for hydropower production, crop irrigation and tourism in France, Spain and Andorra. Complementary to in situ observations, satellite remote sensing is useful to monitor the effect of climate on the snow dynamics. The MODIS daily snow products (Terra/MOD10A1 and Aqua/MYD10A1) are widely used to generate snow cover climatologies, yet it is preferable to assess their accuracies prior to their use. Here, we use both in situ snow observations and remote sensing data to evaluate the MODIS snow products in the Pyrenees. First, we compare the MODIS products to in situ snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements. We estimate the values of the SWE and SD best detection thresholds to 40 mm water equivalent (w.e.) and 150 mm, respectively, for both MOD10A1 and MYD10A1. {$\kappa$} coefficients are within 0.74 and 0.92 depending on the product and the variable for these thresholds. However, we also find a seasonal trend in the optimal SWE and SD thresholds, reflecting the hysteresis in the relationship between the depth of the snowpack (or SWE) and its extent within a MODIS pixel. Then, a set of Landsat images is used to validate MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 for 157 dates between 2002 and 2010. The resulting accuracies are 97\% ({$\kappa$} = 0.85) for MOD10A1 and 96\% ({$\kappa$} = 0.81) for MYD10A1, which indicates a good agreement between both data sets. The effect of vegetation on the results is analyzed by filtering the forested areas using a land cover map. As expected, the accuracies decrease over the forests but the agreement remains acceptable (MOD10A1: 96\%, {$\kappa$} = 0.77; MYD10A1: 95\%, {$\kappa$} = 0.67). We conclude that MODIS snow products have a sufficient accuracy for hydroclimate studies at the scale of the Pyrenees range. Using a gap-filling algorithm we generate a consistent snow cover climatology, which allows us to compute the mean monthly snow cover duration per elevation band and aspect classes. There is snow on the ground at least 50\% of the time above 1600 m between December and April. We finally analyze the snow patterns for the atypical winter 2011\textendash 2012. Snow cover duration anomalies reveal a deficient snowpack on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees, which seems to have caused a drop in the national hydropower production.},

  abstract = {Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local ``pockets'' of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

  abstract = {Large-scale crop monitoring and yield estimation are important for both scientific research and practical applications. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82\% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15\% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar backscatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and OCO-2, for agricultural applications.},

The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.},

Standard products include daily and 8-day composite 500 m resolution swath and tile products (which include fractional snow cover (FSC) and snow albedo), and 0{$\cdot$}05\textdegree{} resolution products on a climate-modelling grid (CMG) (which also include FSC). These snow products (from Collection 4 (C4) reprocessing) are mature and most have been validated to varying degrees and are available to order through the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The overall absolute accuracy of the well-studied 500 m resolution swath (MOD10\_L2) and daily tile (MOD10A1) products is {$\sim$}93\%, but varies by land-cover type and snow condition. The most frequent errors are due to snow/cloud discrimination problems, however, improvements in the MODIS cloud mask, an input product, have occurred in `Collection 5' reprocessing. Detection of very thin snow ({$<$}1 cm thick) can also be problematic. Validation of MOD10\_L2 and MOD10A1 applies to all higher-level products because all the higher-level products are all created from these products. The composited products may have larger errors due, in part, to errors propagated from daily products. Recently, new products have been developed. A fractional snow cover algorithm for the 500 m resolution products was developed, and is part of the C5 daily swath and tile products; a monthly CMG snow product at 0{$\cdot$}05\textdegree{} resolution and a daily 0{$\cdot$}25\textdegree{} resolution CMG snow product are also now available. Similar, but not identical products are also produced from the MODIS on the Aqua satellite, launched in May 2002, but the accuracy of those products has not yet been assessed in detail.

  abstract = {Abstract. MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cryosphere products have been available since 2000 \textendash{} following the 1999 launch of the Terra MODIS and the 2002 launch of the Aqua MODIS \textendash{} and include global snow-cover extent~(SCE) (swath, daily, and 8\,d composites) at 500\,m and {$\sim$}5\,km spatial resolutions. These products are used extensively in hydrological modeling and climate studies. Reprocessing of the complete snow-cover data record, from Collection~5~(C5) to Collection~6~(C6) and Collection~6.1~(C6.1), has provided improvements in the MODIS product suite. Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership~(S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite~(VIIRS) Collection~1~(C1) snow-cover products at a 375\,m spatial resolution have been available since~2011 and are currently being reprocessed for Collection~2~(C2). Both the MODIS~C6.1 and the VIIRS~C2 products will be available for download from the National Snow and Ice Data Center beginning in early 2020 with the complete time series available in~2020. To address the need for a cloud-reduced or cloud-free daily SCE product for both MODIS and VIIRS, a daily cloud-gap-filled~(CGF) snow-cover algorithm was developed for MODIS~C6.1 and VIIRS~C2 processing. MOD10A1F (Terra) and MYD10A1F (Aqua) are daily, 500\,m resolution CGF SCE map products from MODIS. VNP10A1F is the daily, 375\,m resolution CGF SCE map product from VIIRS. These CGF products include quality-assurance data such as cloud-persistence statistics showing the age of the observation in each pixel. The objective of this paper is to introduce the new MODIS and VIIRS standard CGF daily SCE products and to provide a preliminary evaluation of uncertainties in the gap-filling methodology so that the products can be used as the basis for a moderate-resolution Earth science data record~(ESDR) of SCE. Time series of the MODIS and VIIRS CGF products have been developed and evaluated at selected study sites in the~US and southern Canada. Observed differences, although small, are largely attributed to cloud masking and differences in the time of day of image acquisition. A nearly 3-month time-series comparison of Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS CGF snow-cover maps for a large study area covering all or parts of 11 states in the western~US and part of southwestern Canada reveals excellent correspondence between the Terra MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS products, with a mean difference of 11\,070\,km2, which is {$\sim$}0.45\,\% of the study area. According to our preliminary validation of the Terra and Aqua MODIS CGF SCE products in the western~US study area, we found higher accuracy of the Terra product compared with the Aqua product. The MODIS CGF SCE data record beginning in 2000 has been extended into the VIIRS era, which should last at least through the early~2030s.},

  abstract = {On December 18, 1999, the Terra satellite was launched with a complement of five instruments including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Many geophysical products are derived from MODIS data including global snow-cover products. MODIS snow and ice products have been available through the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) since September 13, 2000. MODIS snow-cover products represent potential improvement to or enhancement of the currently available operational products mainly because the MODIS products are global and 500-m resolution, and have the capability to separate most snow and clouds. The MODIS snow-mapping algorithms are automated, which means that a consistent data set may be generated for longterm climate studies that require snow-cover information. Extensive quality assurance (QA) information is stored with the products. The MODIS snow product suite begins with a 500-m resolution, 2330-km swath snow-cover map, which is then gridded to an integerized sinusoidal grid to produce daily and 8-day composite tile products. The sequence proceeds to a climate-modeling grid (CMG) product at 0.05j resolution, with both daily and 8-day composite products. Each pixel of the daily CMG contains fraction of snow cover from 40\% to 100\%. Measured errors of commission in the CMG are low, for example, on the continent of Australia in the spring, they vary from 0.02\% to 0.10\%. Near-term enhancements include daily snow albedo and fractional snow cover. A case study from March 6, 2000, involving MODIS data and field and aircraft measurements, is presented to show some early validation work.},

  abstract = {The Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah has been shrinking since the middle of the 19th Century, leading to decreased area and volume, and increased salinity. We use satellite data products from the Terra and Aqua MODerateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat-7 and -8 satellites, along with meteorological and streamflow data, and modeled data products to study the relationship between changing snow-cover con\- ditions and the decline of the GSL since 2000 in the context of the historical record of lake levels. The GSL basin includes much of the snow-dominated Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges to the east of the lake. Snowmelt feeds the Bear, Jordan, and Weber rivers which are the three main rivers that flow into the lake. Snowmelttiming maps, derived from a new MODIS standard snow-cover product, MOD10A1F, show that snow melted \textasciitilde 9.5 days earlier in the GSL basin during the study period, extending from 2000 to 2018. Air temperatures derived from 26 meteorological stations and surface temperatures measured by the Aqua MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products, MYD21A1D and MYD21A1N, show trends of increasing temperature of \textasciitilde 0.94 \textdegree C ({$\alpha$} = 0.05), and \textasciitilde{} 2.18 \textdegree C, respectively, with most of the LST trends in the GSL basin being statistically sig\- nificant ({$\alpha$} = 0.05). Increasing air temperatures in the basin have led to less precipitation falling as snow, lower snow depth (by \textasciitilde 34.5 mm ({$\alpha$} = 0.01)) and snow-water equivalent (0.02 mm ({$\alpha$} = 0.01)), and earlier snowmelt. Also during the study period, Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Model data show evaporation in\- creasing by \textasciitilde 3.2 mm/yr, with trends in much of the basin being statistically significant ({$\alpha$} = 0.05). Trends calculated from the various products are generally in agreement indicating higher temperatures, greater eva\- poration, less snowfall and snow-on-the ground, and earlier snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt contributes to in\- creasing evaporative loss from water flowing toward the lake. Furthermore, a lower mountain snowpack and less precipitation falling as snow (versus rain) is associated with lower stream discharge even if overall precipitation stays the same. The surface-water temperature of the GSL also increased over the study period by \textasciitilde 0.69 \textdegree C, according to the MODIS LST data products, the surface-water elevation of the lake dropped by \textasciitilde 1.7 m between 2000 and 2018, and the areal extent of the lake decreased by \textasciitilde 901 km2 as measured using Landsat imagery. Desiccation of the lake is associated with deleterious effects on wildlife, recreational activities, and some local industries. And, importantly, an expanding lake bed can also fuel dust storms that promote dangerous air quality along the Wasatch Front. This work elucidates the key role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting earlier snowmelt and other changes in the GSL basin that influence the ongoing decline of the Great Salt Lake.},

  abstract = {Abstract Forecasting the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and runoff is critical to managing mountain water resources. Warming temperatures are increasing the rain\textendash snow transition elevation and are limiting the forecasting skill of statistical models relating historical snow water equivalent to streamflow. While physically based methods are available, they require accurate estimations of the spatial and temporal distribution of meteorological variables in complex terrain. Across many mountainous areas, measurements of precipitation and other meteorological variables are limited to a few reference stations and are not adequate to resolve the complex interactions between topography and atmospheric flow. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to approximate the inputs required for a physics-based snow model, iSnobal, instead of using meteorological measurements, for the Boise River Basin (BRB) in Idaho, United States. An iSnobal simulation using station data from 40 locations in and around the BRB resulted in an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.5 mm compared with 12 SNOTEL measurements. Applying WRF forcings alone was associated with an RMSE of 10.5 mm, while including a simple bias correction to the WRF outputs of temperature and precipitation reduced the RMSE to 6.5 mm. The results highlight the utility of using WRF outputs as input to snowmelt models, as all required input variables are spatiotemporally complete. This will have important benefits in areas with sparse measurement networks and will aid snowmelt and runoff forecasting in mountainous basins.},

Here, we present the Automated Water Supply Model (AWSM) that streamlines and standardizes the workflow of a physically based snow model to create fully reproducible model simulations that can be utilized by researchers and operational water resource managers. AWSM orchestrates four core components that historically required significant, ad-hoc modeler interaction to load the input data, spatially interpolate to the modeling domain, run the models and process the outputs. Because AWSM was developed using principles and techniques from software engineering, users can quickly perform reproducible simulations on any operating system, from a laptop to the cloud. The three fully reproducible example case studies showcase the simplicity and flexibility of using AWSM to perform simulations from small research catchments to simulations that aid in real time water management decisions.},

  abstract = {In the Western US and many mountainous regions of the world, critical water resources and climate conditions are difficult to monitor because the observation network is generally very sparse. The critical resource from the mountain snowpack is water flowing into streams and reservoirs that will provide for irrigation, flood control, power generation, and ecosystem services. Water supply forecasting in a rapidly changing climate has become increasingly difficult because of non-stationary conditions. In response, operational water supply managers have begun to move from statistical techniques towards the use of physically based models. As we begin to transition physically based models from research to operational use, we must address the most difficult and time-consuming aspect of model initiation: the need for robust methods to develop and distribute the input forcing data. In this paper, we present a new open source framework, the Spatial Modeling for Resources Framework (SMRF), which automates and simplifies the common forcing data distribution methods. It is computationally efficient and can be implemented for both research and operational applications. We present an example of how SMRF is able to generate all of the forcing data required to a run physically based snow model at 50\textendash 100~m resolution over regions of 1000\textendash 7000~km2. The approach has been successfully applied in real time and historical applications for both the Boise River Basin in Idaho, USA and the Tuolumne River Basin in California, USA. These applications use meteorological station measurements and numerical weather prediction model outputs as input. SMRF has significantly streamlined the modeling workflow, decreased model set up time from weeks to days, and made near real-time application of a physically based snow model possible.},

  abstract = {Accurately simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of mountain snow water equivalent improves estimates of available meltwater and benefits the water resource management community. In this paper we present the first integration of lidar-derived distributed snow depth data into a physics-based snow model using direct insertion. Over four winter seasons (2013\textendash 2016) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) performed near-weekly lidar surveys throughout the snowmelt season to measure snow depth at high resolution over the Tuolumne River Basin above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The modeling component of the ASO program implements the iSnobal model to estimate snow density for converting measured depths to snow water equivalent and to provide temporally complete snow cover mass and thermal states between flights. Over the four years considered in this study, snow depths from 36 individual lidar flights were directly inserted into the model to provide updates of snow depth and distribution. Considering all updates to the model, the correlation between ASO depths and modeled depths with and without previous updates was on average r2 = 0.899 (root-mean-square error = 12.5 cm) and r2 = 0.162 (root-mean-square error = 41.5 cm), respectively. The precise definition of the snow depth distribution integrated with the iSnobal model demonstrates how the ASO program represents a new paradigm for the measurement and modeling of mountain snowpacks and reveals the potential benefits for managing water in the region.},

Among the most notable of the past upgrades to the IMS are a 4-km resolution grid output, ingest of an automated snow detection algorithm, expansion to a global extent, and a static Digital Elevation Model for mapping based on elevation. Further developments to this dynamic system will continue as NOAA strives to improve snow parameterization for weather forecast modeling. Several future short-term enhancements will be evaluated for possible transition to operations before the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2006\textendash 2007. Current and historical data will be adopted to a geographic information systems (GIS) format before 2007, as well. Longer-term enhancements are also planned to account for new snow data sources, mapping methodologies and user requirements.

  abstract = {The UAVSAR instrument, employing an L-band actively electronically scanned antenna, had its genesis in the ESTO Instrument Incubator Program and after 3 years of development has begun collecting engineering and science data. System design was motivated by solid Earth applications where repeat pass radar interferometry can be used to measure subtle deformation of the surface, however flexibility and extensibility to support other applications were also major design drivers. In fact a Ka-band single-pass radar interferometer for making high precision topographic maps of ice sheets is being developed based to a large extent on components of the UAVSAR L-band radar. By designing the radar to be housed in an external unpressurized pod, it has the potential to be readily ported to many platforms. Initial testing is being carried out with the NASA Gulfstream III aircraft, which has been modified to accommodate the radar pod and has been equipped with precision autopilot capability developed by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. With this the aircraft can fly within a 10 m diameter tube on any specified trajectory necessary for repeat-pass radar interferometric applications. To maintain the required pointing for repeat-pass interferometric applications we have employed an actively scanned antenna steered using INU measurement data. This paper presents a brief overview of the radar instrument and some of the first imagery obtained from the system.},

  abstract = {Very-high-resolution (VHR) optical imaging satellites can offer precise, accurate, and direct measurements of snow-covered areas (SCA) with sub-meter to meter-scale resolution in regions of complex land cover and terrain. We explore the potential of Maxar WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 in-track stereo images (WV) for land and snow cover mapping at two sites in the Western U.S. with different snow regimes, topographies, vegetation, and underlying geology. We trained random forest models using combinations of multispectral bands and normalized difference indices (i.e., NDVI) to produce land cover maps for priority feature classes (snow, shaded snow, vegetation, water, and exposed ground). We then created snow-covered area products from these maps and compared them with coarser resolution satellite fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) products from Landsat (\textasciitilde 30 m) and MODIS (\textasciitilde 500 m). Our models generated accurate classifications, even with limited combinations of available multispectral bands. Models trained on a single image demonstrated limited model transfer, with best results found for in-region transfers. Coarser-resolution Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA products identified many more pixels as completely snow-covered (100\% fSCA) than WV fSCA. However, while MODSCAG fSCA products also identified many more completely snow-free pixels (0\% fSCA) than WV fSCA, Landsat fSCA products only slightly underestimated the number of completely snow-free pixels. Overall, our results demonstrate that strategic image observations with VHR satellites such as WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 can complement the existing operational snow data products to map the evolution of seasonal snow cover.},

  abstract = {Improving high-resolution (meter-scale) mapping of snow-covered areas in complex and forested terrains is critical to understanding the responses of species and water systems to climate change. Commercial high-resolution imagery from Planet Labs, Inc. (Planet, San Francisco, CA, USA) can be used in environmental science, as it has both high spatial (0.7\textendash 3.0 m) and temporal (1\textendash 2 day) resolution. Deriving snow-covered areas from Planet imagery using traditional radiometric techniques have limitations due to the lack of a shortwave infrared band that is needed to fully exploit the difference in reflectance to discriminate between snow and clouds. However, recent work demonstrated that snow cover area (SCA) can be successfully mapped using only the PlanetScope 4-band (Red, Green, Blue and NIR) reflectance products and a machine learning (ML) approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). To evaluate how additional features improve the existing model performance, we: (1) build on previous work to augment a CNN model with additional input data including vegetation metrics (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and DEM-derived metrics (elevation, slope and aspect) to improve SCA mapping in forested and open terrain, (2) evaluate the model performance at two geographically diverse sites (Gunnison, Colorado, USA and Engadin, Switzerland), and (3) evaluate the model performance over different land-cover types. The best augmented model used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with visible (red, green, and blue) and NIR bands, with an F-score of 0.89 (Gunnison) and 0.93 (Engadin) and was found to be 4\% and 2\% better than when using canopy height- and terrain-derived measures at Gunnison, respectively. The NDVI-based model improves not only upon the original band-only model's ability to detect snow in forests, but also across other various land-cover types (gaps and canopy edges). We examined the model's performance in forested areas using three forest canopy quantification metrics and found that augmented models can better identify snow in canopy edges and open areas but still underpredict snow cover under forest canopies. While the new features improve model performance over band-only options, the models still have challenges identifying the snow under trees in dense forests, with performance varying as a function of the geographic area. The improved high-resolution snow maps in forested environments can support studies involving climate change effects on mountain ecosystems and evaluations of hydrological impacts in snow-dominated river basins.},

This study reviewed 112 studies on fusing optical and radar data, which offer unique spectral and structural information, for land cover and use assessments. Contrary to our expectations, only 50 studies specifically addressed land use, and five assessed land use changes, while the majority addressed land cover. The advantages of fusion for land use analysis were assessed in 32 studies, and a large majority (28 studies) concluded that fusion improved results compared to using single data sources. Study sites were small, frequently 300\textendash 3000 km2 or individual plots, with a lack of comparison of results and accuracies across sites. Although a variety of fusion techniques were used, pre-classification fusion followed by pixel-level inputs in traditional classification algorithms (e.g., Gaussian maximum likelihood classification) was common, but often without a concrete rationale on the applicability of the method to the land use theme being studied. Progress in this field of research requires the development of robust techniques of fusion to map the intricacies of land uses and changes therein and systematic procedures to assess the benefits of fusion over larger spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Snow can cover over 50\% of the landmass in the Northern Hemisphere and has been labelled as an Essential Climate Variable by the World Meteorological Organisation. Currently, continental and global snow cover extent is primarily monitored by optical satellite sensors. There are, however, no large-scale demonstrations for methods that (1) use all the spectral information that is measured by the satellite sensor, (2) estimate fractional snow and (3) provide a pixel-wise quantitative uncertainty estimate. This paper proposes a locally adaptive method for estimating the snow-covered fraction (SCF) per pixel from all the spectral reflective bands available at spaceborne sensors. In addition, a comprehensive procedure for root-mean-square error (RMSE) estimation through error propagation is given. The method adapts the SCF estimates for shaded areas from variable solar illumination conditions and accounts for different snow-free and snow-covered surfaces. To test and evaluate the algorithm, SCF maps were generated from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI data covering various mountain regions around the world. Subsequently, the SCF maps were validated with coincidentally acquired very-high-resolution satellite data from WorldView-2/3. This validation revealed a bias of 0.2\% and an RMSE of 14.3\%. The proposed method was additionally tested with Sentinel-3 SLSTR/OLCI, Suomi NPP VIIRS and Terra MODIS data. The SCF estimations from these satellite data are consistent (bias less than 2.2\% SCF) despite their different spatial resolutions.},

  abstract = {MODIS, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, will be launched in 1998 as part of the first earth observing system (EOS) platform. Global maps of land surface properties, including snow cover, will be created from MODIS imagery. The MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm that will be used to produce daily maps of global snow cover extent at 500 m resolution is currently under development. With the exception of cloud cover, the largest limitation to producing a global daily snow cover product using MODIS is the presence of a forest canopy. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) time-series of the southern Boreal Ecosystem\textendash Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) study area in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, was used to evaluate the performance of the current MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm in varying forest types. A snow reflectance model was used in conjunction with a canopy reflectance model (GeoSAIL) to model the reflectance of a snow-covered forest stand. Using these coupled models, the effects of varying forest type, canopy density, snow grain size and solar illumination geometry on the performance of the MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm were investigated. Using both the TM images and the reflectance models, two changes to the current MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm are proposed that will improve the algorithm's classification accuracy in forested areas. The improvements include using the normalized difference snow index and normalized difference vegetation index in combination to discriminate better between snow-covered and snow-free forests. A minimum albedo threshold of 10\% in the visible wavelengths is also proposed. This will prevent dense forests with very low visible albedos from being classified incorrectly as snow. These two changes increase the amount of snow mapped in forests on snow-covered TM scenes, and decrease the area incorrectly identified as snow on non-snow-covered TM scenes. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The emphasis of the project is to develop methods to monitor the snow melt period during spring time. The test site is located in northern Finland, and it consists of the drainage area of River Kemi, which is the largest river in Finland. A total of 18 ERS-2 SAR and six cloudless AVHRR images have been acquired from the test site during the spring of 1997. These images cover totally the snow melt period starting from dry snow and ending to snow-free ground. The optical and microwave radar data sets were compared to each other and to in situ measurements made on the weather stations which are used for current operative snow mapping. The results show that SAR-derived snow cover maps agree reasonably well with ground based observations, and they have a good correlation with AVHRR reflectance for open areas (r=0.82), and even in the presence of vegetation the correlation is relatively high (r=0.77).},

The NISAR algorithm uses the coefficient of variation (CV) to perform crop/noncrop classification at 100 m. We evaluate classifications using three accuracy metrics (overall accuracy, J-statistic, Cohen's Kappa) and spatial resolutions (10, 30, and 100 m) for crop/noncrop delineating CV thresholds (CVthr) ranging from 0 to 1 in 0.01 increments. All but the 10 m 129A product exceeded NISAR's mission accuracy requirement of 80\%. The UAVSAR 10 m data performed best, achieving maximum overall accuracy, J-statistic, and Kappa values of 85\%, 0.62, and 0.60. The same metrics for the 129A product respectively are: 77\%, 0.40, 0.36 at 10 m; 81\%, 0.55, 0.49 at 30 m; 80\%, 0.58, 0.50 at 100 m. We found that using a literature recommended CVthr value of 0.5 yielded suboptimal accuracy (65\%) at this site and that optimal CVthr values monotonically decreased with decreasing spatial resolution.},

Over the journal's second 25 years, that changed remarkably, and remote sensing is now widely used in hydrology and other geophysical sciences. We attribute this evolution to production of data sets that scientists not well versed in remote sensing can use, and to educational initiatives like NASA's Earth System Science Fellowship program that has supported over a thousand scientists, many in hydrology. We review progress in remote sensing in hydrology from a water balance perspective. We argue that progress is primarily attributable to a creative use of existing and past satellite sensors to estimate such variables as evapotranspiration rates or water storage in lakes and reservoirs and to new and planned missions. Recent transforming technologies include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and U.S. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Future missions include Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) to measure river discharge and lake, reservoir, and wetland storage. Measurement of some important hydrologic variables remains problematic: retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) from space remains elusive especially in mountain areas, even though snow cover extent is well observed, and was the topic of 4 of the first 5 remote sensing papers published in WRR. We argue that this area deserves more strategic thinking from the hydrology community.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100\,m, 500\,m, and 1\,km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017\textendash 2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500\,m and 1\,km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20\,\%\textendash 30\,\% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3\,m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100\,m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.},

This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change.},

  abstract = {The transition of a cold winter snowpack to one that is ripe and contributing to runoff is crucial to gauge for water resource management, but is highly variable in space and time. Snow surface melt/freeze cycles, associated with diurnal fluctuations in radiative inputs, are hallmarks of this transition. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reliably detects meltwater in the snowpack. Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band SAR offers consistent acquisition patterns that allow for diurnal investigations of melting snow. We used over 50 snow pit observations from 2020 in Grand Mesa, Colorado, USA, to track temperature and wetness in the snowpack as a function of depth and time during snowpack phases of warming, ripening, and runoff. We also ran the physically-based SnowModel, which provided a spatially and temporally continuous independent indication of snowpack conditions. Snowpack phases were identified and corroborated by comparing field measurements with SnowModel outputs. Knowledge of snowpack warming, ripening, and runoff phases was used to interpret diurnal changes in S1 backscatter values. Both field measurements and SnowModel simulations suggested that S1 SAR was not sensitive to the initial snowpack warming phase on Grand Mesa. In the ripening and runoff phases, the diurnal cycle in S1 SAR co-polarized backscatter was affected by both surface melt/freeze as well as the conditions of the snowpack underneath (ripening or ripe). The ripening phase was associated with significant increases in morning backscatter values, likely due to volume scattering from surface melt/freeze crusts, as well as significant decreases in evening backscatter values associated with snowmelt. During the runoff phase, both morning and evening backscatter decreased compared to reference values. These unique S1 diurnal signatures, and their interpretations using field measurements and SnowModel outputs, highlight the capacities and limitations of S1 SAR to understand snow surface states and bulk phases, which may offer runoff forecasting or energy balance model validation or parameterization, especially useful in remote or sparsely-gauged alpine basins.},

These same regions are predominantly forested, with forests highly vulnerable to change. Here we combine a meta-analysis of observational studies across the globe with modeling to show that in regions with average December-January-February (DJF) temperatures greater than -1\textdegree C, forest cover reduces snow duration by 1\textendash 2 weeks compared to adjacent open areas. This occurs because the dominant effect of forest cover shifts from slowing snowmelt by shading the snow and blocking the wind to accelerating snowmelt from increasing longwave radiation. In many locations, midwinter melt removes forest snow before solar radiation is great enough for forest shading to matter, and with warming temperatures, midwinter melt is likely to become more widespread. This temperature-effect in forest-snow-climate interactions must be considered in representations of the combined ecohydrological system and can be used advantageously in forest management strategies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) based on remote sensing have been elusive, particularly in mountain areas. However, there now appears to be some potential for direct satellite-based SWE observations along ground tracks that only cover a portion of a spatial domain (e.g., watershed). Fortunately, spatiotemporally continuous meteorological and surface variables could be leveraged to infer SWE in the gaps between satellite ground tracks. Here, we evaluate statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches to performing track-to-area (TTA) transformations of SWE observations in California's upper Tuolumne River watershed using synthetic data. The synthetic SWE measurements are designed to mimic a potential future P-band Signals of Opportunity (P-SoOP) satellite mission with a (along-track) spatial resolution of about 500\,m. We construct relationships between multiple meteorological and surface variables and synthetic SWE observations along observation tracks, and we then extend these relationships to unobserved areas between ground tracks to estimate SWE over the entire watershed. Domain-wide, SWE inferred on 1~April using two synthetic satellite tracks ({$\sim$}4.5\,\% basin coverage) led to percent errors of basin-averaged SWE (PEBAS) of 24.5\,\%, 4.5\,\% and 6.3\,\% in an extremely dry water year (WY2015), a normal water year (WY2008) and an extraordinarily wet water year (WY2017), respectively. Assuming a 10\,d overpass interval, percent errors of basin-averaged SWE during both snow accumulation and snowmelt seasons were mostly less than 10\,\%. We employ a feature sensitivity analysis to overcome the black-box nature of ML methods and increase the explainability of the ML results. Our feature sensitivity analysis shows that precipitation is the dominant variable controlling the TTA SWE estimation, followed by net long-wave radiation (NetLong). We find that a modest increase in the accuracy of SWE estimation occurs when more than two ground tracks are leveraged. The accuracy of 1~April SWE estimation is only modestly improved for track repeats more often than about 15\,d.},

Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2, with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this region we observed both scouring and drifting, with a dynamic range of {$\pm$} 20 cm. We use the measured surface density, change in phase, and local incidence angle to estimate change in snow depth over approximately a 2 week period, with a RMSD of 4.7cm depth, and 0.9cm SWE.

We present multi-year simulations at 2 m resolution obtained with FSM2, a mass- and energy-balance-based forest snow model specifically developed and validated for metre-scale applications. We simulate an {$\sim$}3 km2 model domain encompassing forested slopes of a sub-alpine valley in the eastern Swiss Alps and six snow seasons. Simulations thus span a wide range of canopy structures, terrain characteristics, and meteorological conditions. We analyse spatial and temporal variations in forest snow energy balance partitioning, aiming to quantify and understand the contribution of individual energy exchange processes at different locations and times. Our results suggest that snow cover evolution is equally affected by canopy structure, terrain characteristics, and meteorological conditions. We show that the interaction of these three factors can lead to snow accumulation and ablation patterns that vary between years. We further identify higher snow distribution variability and complexity in slopes that receive solar radiation early in winter. Our process-level insights corroborate and complement existing empirical findings that are largely based on snow distribution datasets only. Hyper-resolution simulations as presented here thus help to better understand how snowpacks and ecohydrological regimes in sub-alpine regions may evolve due to forest disturbances and a warming climate. They could further support the development of process-based sub-grid forest snow cover parameterizations or tiling approaches for coarse-resolution modelling applications.},

  abstract = {In the spring of 1994, the first of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) next generation of geostationary satellites, GOES-I, is scheduled for launch. The introduction of this major component of NOAA's modernization represents a significant advance in geostationary remote sensing. All major components of the GOES-I system are new or greatly improved: 1) the satellite is earth oriented to improve instrument performance; 2) sounding and imaging operations are now performed by different and separate instruments; 3) a five-band multispectral radiometer with higher spatial resolution improves imaging capabilities; 4) a sounder with higher radiometric sensitivity enables operational temperature and moisture profile retrieval from geostationary altitude for the first time; 5) a different data format is used to retransmit raw data to directreceive users; and 6) a new ground data processing system handles the high data volume and distributes advanced products to a variety of users. This article describes the features of the GOES-I spacecraft and instruments, imaging and sounding schedules, data handling systems, and remote sensing products. Simulations of GOES-I imager and sounder products are presented and compared with GOES-7 products. The simulations show that GOES-I imagery, derived product images, and sounder products should be significant improvements in both frequency of coverage and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Operational water-resource forecasters, such as the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) in the Western United States, currently rely on historical records to calibrate the temperature-index models used for snowmelt runoff predictions. This data dependence is increasingly challenged, with global and regional climatological factors changing the seasonal snowpack dynamics in mountain watersheds. To evaluate and improve the CBRFC modeling options, this work ran the physically based snow energy balance iSnobal model, forced with outputs from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction model across 4 years in a Colorado River Basin forecast region. Compared to in situ, remotely sensed, and the current operational CBRFC model data, the HRRR-iSnobal combination showed well-reconstructed snow depth patterns and magnitudes until peak accumulation. Once snowmelt set in, HRRR-iSnobal showed slower simulated snowmelt relative to observations, depleting snow on average up to 34 d later. The melting period is a critical component for water forecasting. Based on the results, there is a need for revised forcing data input preparation (shortwave radiation) required by iSnobal, which is a recommended future improvement to the model. Nevertheless, the presented performance and architecture make HRRR-iSnobal a promising combination for the CBRFC production needs, where there is a demonstrated change to the seasonal snow in the mountain ranges around the Colorado River Basin. The long-term goal is to introduce the HRRR-iSnobal combination in day-to-day CBRFC operations, and this work created the foundation to expand and evaluate larger CBRFC domains.},

Maps are presented over the Tuolumne River Basin region of the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, and compared with those collected by a scanning lidar onboard the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory for the same region on the same snow day. For this observation, the snow surface was wet and melting and as such penetration of the electromagnetic wave into the snow volume can be effectively neglected. Despite the rugged terrain, heavy tree-cover, and very low snow-volume, depth maps had a standard deviation {$<$};1 m with the largest differences occurring on slopes exceeding 40\textdegree. While additional evaluation is needed with demonstration of the InSAR capability over a greater range of conditions and terrain, these results are promising. InSAR for snow-depth mapping holds significant advantages for a spaceborne mission if proven viable as it can operate through cloud cover, day or night, and measure snowpack when wet or melting.},

In order to extend the continuity of these estimates in time and space to areas beneath the cloud cover, gridded temperature data were used to define the spatial domain of SWE interpolation in the Salt\textendash Verde watershed of Arizona. Gridded positive accumulated degree-days (ADD) and binary SCA (derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) were used to define a threshold ADD to define the area of snow cover. The optimized threshold ADD increased during snow accumulation periods, reaching a peak at maximum snow extent. The threshold then decreased dramatically during the first time period after peak snow extent owing to the low amount of energy required to melt the thin snow cover at lower elevations. The area having snow cover at this later time was then used to define the area for which SWE interpolation was done. The area simulated to have snow was compared with observed SCA from AVHRR to assess the simulated snow map accuracy. During periods without precipitation, the average commission and omission errors of the optimal technique were 7\% and 11\% respectively, with a map accuracy of 82\%. Average map accuracy decreased to 75\% during storm periods, with commission and omission errors equal to 11\% and 12\% respectively. The analysis shows that temperature data can be used to help estimate the snow extent beneath clouds and therefore improve the spatial and temporal continuity of SCA and SWE products.

However, evaluation of such algorithms in forested landscapes is rare due to lack of reliable in situ data in such regions. In this investigation, we assessed the performance of the operational snow detection (SCA) and fractional snow cover estimation (FSC) algorithms employed by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service for High-Resolution Snow \& Ice Monitoring (HRSI) with a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8 satellite scenes, lidar-based, and in situ datasets. These algorithms were evaluated over test sites located in the forested mountainous landscape of the Pyrenees in Spain and the Sierra Nevada in the USA. Over the Pyrenees site, the effectiveness of snow cover detection was evaluated with respect to a time-series of in situ snow depth measurements logged over test plots with different aspects, canopy cover, and solar irradiance. Over the Sierra Nevada site, the impact of ground vegetation was assessed over the under canopy fractional snow cover retrievals using airborne lidar-derived fractional vegetation cover information. The analyses over the Pyrenees indicated a good accuracy of snow detection with the exception of plots with either dense canopy cover or insufficient solar exposure (shaded forested slope), or both. The operational HRSI algorithm yielded similar performances (25-30\% RMSE) as the computationally intensive spectral unmixing approach while retrieving the subcanopy ground FSC over the Sierra Nevada site. It was observed that a more accurate lidar-derived tree cover density map did not improve the subcanopy FSC retrievals.},

Mapping of snow cover in this region is a critical task, since meltwater emanating from the snowfields and glaciers serves as a source to several major Asian river systems. In this regard, a snow cover mapping technique is proposed in this letter by exploiting the ratio of the seasonal variation of copolarized (hh-vv) correlation coefficient and the total scattering power. This ratio provides a very efficient index for snow characterization. The difference image is obtained by temporal (winter-summer) ratioing of this index. The snow cover map is obtained by thresholding the difference image using the standard method of Otsu. The proposed algorithm is validated using the temporal RADARSAT-2 (FQ-28) C-band full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data sets acquired over the Manali-Dhundi region of Himachal Pradesh, India. The results are explicitly validated with in situ observatory measurements and compared with the normalized difference snow index-based snow cover maps derived from the LANDSAT-8 optical satellite images.},

We developed, tested and evaluated an algorithm for generating maps of snowmelt area from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel-1 mission. For snowmelt classification, a change detection method is applied, using multitemporal dual-polarized SAR data acquired in Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode, the basic operation mode over land surfaces. Of particular benefit for wet snow retrievals are the high instrument stability, the high spatial resolution across the 250 km wide swath, and the short revisit time. In order to study the impact of polarization, we generated maps of melting snow using data of the VV-polarized channel, the VH-polarized channel and a combined VV- and VH-based channel using a weighting function that accounts for effects of the local incidence angle. Comparisons are performed with snow maps derived from Landsat images over study areas in the Alps and in Iceland. The pixel-by-pixel comparisons show good agreement between the snow products of the two sensors, with the best performance for retrievals based on the combined (VV and VH) channel and a minor decline for the VH-based product. The VV-based snowmelt extent product shows a drop-off in quality over areas with steep terrain because of the decreasing backscatter contrast of snow-covered versus snow-free surfaces on fore-slopes. The investigations demonstrate the excellent capability of the Sentinel-1 mission for operational monitoring of snowmelt areas.},

  abstract = {Proper satellite-based crop monitoring applications at the farm-level often require near-daily imagery at medium to high spatial resolution. The combination of data from different ongoing satellite missions Sentinel 2 (ESA) and Landsat 7/8 (NASA) provides this unprecedented opportunity at a global scale; however, this is rarely implemented because these procedures are data demanding and computationally intensive. This study developed a robust stream processing for the harmonization of Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, connecting the benefit of coherent data structure, built-in functions and computational power in the Google Cloud. The harmonized surface reflectance images were generated for two agricultural schemes in Bekaa (Lebanon) and Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) during 2018\textendash 2019. We evaluated the performance of several pre-processing steps needed for the harmonization including the image co-registration, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions correction, topographic correction, and band adjustment. We found that the misregistration between Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images varied from 10 m in Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) to 32 m in Bekaa (Lebanon), and posed a great impact on the quality of the final harmonized data set if not treated. Analysis of a pair of overlapped L8-S2 images over the Bekaa region showed that, after the harmonization, all band-to-band spatial correlations were greatly improved. Finally, we demonstrated an application of the dense harmonized data set for crop mapping and monitoring. An harmonic (Fourier) analysis was applied to fit the detected unimodal, bimodal and trimodal shapes in the temporal NDVI patterns during one crop year in Ninh Thuan province. The derived phase and amplitude values of the crop cycles were combined with max-NDVI as an R-G-B false composite image. The final image was able to highlight croplands in bright colors (high phase and amplitude), while the non-crop areas were shown with grey/dark (low phase and amplitude). The harmonized data sets (with 30 m spatial resolution) along with the Google Earth Engine scripts used are provided for public use.},

Both active and\textasciitilde passive microwave remote sensing methods have been used to retrieve SWE, but there does not currently exist a SWE product that provides useful estimates in mountainous terrain. Active sensors provide higher-resolution observations, but the optimal radar frequencies and temporal repeat intervals have not been available until recently. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been shown to have the potential to estimate SWE change. In this study, we apply this technique to a long time series of Sentinel-1 data from the 2020\&ndash;2021 winter. The retrievals show statistically significant correlations both temporally and spatially with independent measurements of snow depth and SWE. The Pearson correlation and RSME between retrieved SWE change observations and in situ stations measurements are 0.82, and 0.76 cm, respectively. The total retrieved SWE in the entire 2020\&ndash;2021 time series shows SWE error less than 2 cm for the 16 in situ stations in the scene. Additionally, the retrieved SWE using Sentinel-1 data is highly correlated with LIDAR snow depth data with correlation of more than 0.5. Low temporal coherence is the main reason for degrading the performance of SWE retrieval using InSAR data. Low temporal coherence also causes the degradation of phase unwrapping algorithms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in many of the world's mountainous regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/ SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the first operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that deposition of dust and black carbon to snow and ice accelerates snowmelt and perturbs regional climate and hydrologic cycles. Radiative forcing by aerosols is often neglected in climate and hydrological models in part due to scarcity of observations. Here we describe and validate an algorithm suite (Imaging Spectrometer-Snow Albedo and Radiative Forcing (IS-SnARF)) that provides quantitative retrievals of snow grain size, snow albedo, and radiative forcing by light-absorbing impurities in snow and ice (LAISI) from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected on 15 June 2011 in the Senator Beck Basin Study Area (SBBSA), SW Colorado, USA. Radiative forcing by LAISI is retrieved by the integral of the convolution of spectral irradiance with spectral differences between the spectral albedo (scaled from the observed hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF)) and modeled clean snow spectral albedo. The modeled surface irradiance at time of acquisition at test sites was 1052 W m-2 compared to 1048 W m-2 measured with the field spectroradiometer measurements, a relative difference of 0.4\%. HDRF retrievals at snow and bare soil sites had mean errors relative to in situ measurements of -0.4 {$\pm$} 0.1\% reflectance averaged across the spectrum and root-mean-square errors of 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.1\%. Comparisons of snow albedo and radiative forcing retrievals from AVIRIS with in situ measurements in SBBSA showed errors of 0.001\textendash 0.004 and 2.1 {$\pm$} 5.1 W m-2, respectively. A counterintuitive result was that, in the presence of light absorbing impurities, near-surface snow grain size increased with elevation, whereas we generally expect that at lower elevation the grain size would be larger.},

Grain size measurements are validated with field measurements during the Cold Land Processes Experiment, and albedo retrievals are validated with in situ measurements in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The pixelweighted average RMS error for snow-covered area across 31 scenes is 5\%, ranging from 1\% to 13\%. The mean absolute error for grain size was 51 \textmu m and the mean absolute error for albedo was 4.2\%. Fractional snow cover errors are relatively insensitive to solar zenith angle.

  abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used widely for mapping snow cover in climate and hydrologic systems, but its accuracy is reduced in forests due to canopy obstruction. Prior validation datasets cannot quantify MODIS errors in forests, because finer-resolution passive sensors (e.g., Landsat) encounter the same canopy errors, and operational ground-based networks sample snow in clearings where snow dynamics differ from those in the forest. To assess MODIS accuracy relative to forest cover, we applied a common canopy adjustment to daily 500 m fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) from the physically-based MODIS Snow-Covered Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) algorithm, and tested it at subalpine meadow and forest sites (0.25 km2\textendash 1 km2) in the Sierra Nevada, California during two snow seasons. 37 to 89 sensors monitored hourly ground temperature at these sites. Damped diurnal variations provided a signal for snow presence due to the insulating properties of snow, yielding daily ground-based fSCA at each site. Ground-based fSCA values were validated in a canopy-free area of a meadow site using time-lapse imagery and 15 m snow maps from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Ground-based fSCA had high correlation (R2 = 0.98) with time-lapse data and was within 0.05 of ASTER fSCA. Comparisons between MODSCAG and ground-based fSCA revealed that an underestimation bias remained in the canopy-adjusted MODSCAG fSCA, ranging from -0.09 to -0.22 at the meadow sites and from -0.09 to -0.37 at the forest sites. Improved canopy adjustment methods are needed for MODIS fSCA.},

Snow and ice analysts in the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service have been creating weekly maps showing the extent of snow cover for the Northern Hemisphere since 1966 using visible imagery from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites and surface observations as data sources. The current process is mostly manual and time-consuming, taking up to 10 hours to produce a map during the snow season. Where cloud cover precludes an unobstructed view of an area during the entire week, the analysis from the previous week is carried forward. Each week the analyst draws a new map by hand, then digitizes the extent of snow and ice cover using an 89\texttimes 89 line grid overlaid on a stereographic map of the Northern Hemisphere. The hand-drawn map is photocopied and distributed and the digitized map is saved to a file for use in National Weather Service numerical models and for archival storage. IMS was designed and built to replace and improve this process by producing a more accurate and timely product. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Although photointerpretation methods are completely suitable and recommended for many applications, it is believed that a highly interactive digital processing system, when combined with a skilled remote sensing applications specialist, will provide maximum operational use of satellite snowcover observations. Several studies have shown that satellite-observed snowcovered area is significantly related to various expressions of seasonal streamflow. The results indicate that snowcovered area could be incorporated into conventional snowmelt runoff prediction methods as an additional index parameter for improving streamflow estimates. Additionally, the snowcovered area data are compatible with several numerical hydrologic models and quasioperational tests are being conducted.},

  abstract = {An Earth Observing System global snow cover extent data products record at moderate spatial resolution (375\textendash 500 m) began in February 2000 with the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the Terra satellite. The record continued with the Aqua MODIS in July 2002, the Suomi-National Polar Platform (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in January 2012 and continues with the Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) VIIRS, launched in November of 2017. The objective of this work is to develop a snow cover extent Earth Science Data Record (ESDR) using different satellites, sensors and algorithms. There are many issues to understand when data from different algorithms and sensors are used over a decade-scale time period to create a continuous dataset. Issues may also arise with sensor degradation and even differences in sensor band locations. In this paper we describe development of an ESDR derived from existing MODIS and VIIRS data products and demonstrate continuity among the products. The MODIS and VIIRS snow cover detection algorithms produce very similar daily snow cover maps, with 90\textendash 97\% agreement in snow cover extent (SCE) in different landscapes. Differences in SCE between products ranged from 2\textendash 15\% and are attributable to convolved factors of viewing geometry, pixel spread across a scan and time of observation. Compared at a common grid size of 1 km, there is a mean of 95\% agreement in SCE and a difference range of 1\textendash 10\% between the MODIS and VIIRS SCE maps. Mapping sensor observations to a coarser resolution grid reduces the effect of the factors convolved in the 500 m tile to tile comparisons. We conclude that the MODIS and VIIRS SCE data products are reliable constituents of a moderate-resolution ESDR.},

  abstract = {Characterization of snow is critical for understanding Earth's water and energy cycles. Maps of snow from MODIS have seen growing use in investigations of climate, hydrology, and glaciology, but the lack of rigorous validation of different snow mapping methods compromises these studies. We examine three widely used MODIS snow products: the ``binary'' (i.e., snow yes/no) global snow maps that were among the initial MODIS standard products; a more recent standard MODIS fractional snow product; and another fractional snow product, MODSCAG, based on spectral mixture analysis. We compare them to maps of snow obtained from Landsat ETM+ data, whose 30 m spatial resolution provides nearly 300 samples within a 500 m MODIS nadir pixel. The assessment uses 172 images spanning a range of snow and vegetation conditions, including the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Upper Rio Grande, California's Sierra Nevada, and the Nepal Himalaya. MOD10A1 binary and fractional fail to retrieve snow in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt while MODSCAG consistently maintains its retrieval ability during these periods. Averaged over all regions, the RMSE for MOD10A1 fractional is 0.23, whereas the MODSCAG RMSE is 0.10. MODSCAG performs the most consistently through accumulation, mid-winter and melt, with median differences ranging from \`A0.16 to 0.04 while differences for MOD10A1 fractional range from \`A0.34 to 0.35. MODSCAG maintains its performance over all land cover classes and throughout a larger range of land surface properties. Characterizing snow cover by spectral mixing is more accurate than empirical methods based on the normalized difference snow index, both for identifying where snow is and is not and for estimating the fractional snow cover within a sensor's instantaneous fieldof-view. Determining the fractional value is particularly important during spring and summer melt in mountainous terrain, where large variations in snow, vegetation and soil occur over small distances and when snow can melt rapidly.},

  abstract = {Maps of snow cover serve as early indicators for hydrologic forecasts and as inputs to hydrologic models that inform water management strategies. Advances in snow cover mapping have led to increasing accuracy, but unsatisfactory treatment of vegetation's interference when mapping snow has led to maps that have limited utility for water forecasting. Vegetation affects snow mapping because ground surfaces not visible to the satellite produce uncertainty as to whether the ground is snow covered. At nadir, the forest canopy obscures the satellite view below the canopy. At oblique viewing angles, the forest floor is obscured by both the canopy and the projection of tree profiles onto the forest floor. We present a canopy correction method based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery validated with field observations that mitigates geometric and georegistration issues associated with changing satellite acquisition angles in forested areas. The largest effect from a variable viewing zenith angle on the viewable gap fraction in forested areas occurs in moderately forested areas with 30\textendash 40\% tree canopy coverage. Cloud cover frequently causes errors in snow identification, with some clouds identified as snow and some snow identified as cloud. A snow-cloud identification method utilizes a time series of fractional vegetation and rock land-surface data to flag snow-cloud identification errors and improve snow-map accuracy reducing bias by 20\% over previous methods. Together, these contributions to snow-mapping techniques could advance hydrologic forecasting in forested, snow-dominated basins that comprise an estimated one fifth of Northern Hemisphere snow-covered areas.},

  abstract = {In addition to providing water for nearly 2 billion people, snow drives resource selection by wildlife and in\- fluences the behavior and demography of many species. Because snow cover is highly spatially and temporally variable, mapping its extent using currently available satellite data remains a challenge. At present, there are no sensors acquiring daily data of Earth's entire surface at fine spatial resolutions ({$<$} 30 m) in wavelengths required for snow cover retrieval, namely: visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared. Fine scale observations at 30 m from Landsat are available at 16-day intervals since 1982 and at 8-day intervals since 1999. However, over this duration, snow can accumulate, ablate, or both, making the Landsat data ineffective for many applications. Conversely, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospherically corrected daily reflectance data, have a coarse spatial resolution of 463 m and thus, are not ideal for snow cover mapping either. This spatial and temporal resolution tradeoff limits the use of these data for a wide range of snow cover ap\- plications and indicates a pressing need for data fusion. To address this need, we use a physically-based, spectralmixture-analysis approach for mapping fractional snow cover (fSCA) and a two-stage random forest algorithm to produce daily 30 m fSCA. We test our algorithm in the US Sierra Nevada and find MODIS fSCA is the most important predictor. We cross validate using 170 Landsat scenes and while snow cover varies immensely in time we find little variation in errors between seasons, a small bias of 0.01, and an overall accuracy of 0.97 with slightly higher precision than recall. This technique for accurate, daily, high-resolution snow cover retrievals could be applied more broadly for analyses of regional energy budget, validating snow cover in global and regional models, and for quantifying changes in the availability of biotic resources in ecosystems.},

The mission's primary objectives would be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. To meet demanding coverage, sampling, and accuracy requirements, the system would require a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed. To address the broad range of disciplines and scientific study areas of the mission, a dual-frequency system was conceived, at L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength). To achieve these observational characteristics, a reflector-feed system is considered, whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive (``SweepSAR'') capability at both L-band and S-band. In the partnership, NASA would provide the instrument structure for both L- and S-band electronics, the L-band electronics, the reflector and associated boom, and an avionics payload to interface with the radar that would include a solid state recorder, high-rate Ka-band telecommunication link, and a GPS receiver. ISRO would provide the spacecraft and launch vehicle, and the S-band radar electronics.},

We test the algorithm on a different Thematic Mapper scene and verify with high-resolution, large-format, color aerial photography. The accuracy of the automated classification of Thematic Mapper data equals that obtainable from the aerial photographs but is faster, cheaper, and covers a vastly larger area. The mapping method is insensitive to the choice of lithologic or vegetation end members, the water equivalent of the snow pack, snow grain size, or local illumination angle.},

  abstract = {NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is currently building a reconfigurable, polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), specifically designed to acquire airborne repeat track SAR data for differential interferometric measurements. Differential interferometry can provide key deformation measurements, important for studies of earthquakes, volcanoes and other dynamically changing phenomena. Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system will be able to fly predefined paths with great precision. The expected performance of the flight control system will constrain the flight path to be within a 10 m diameter tube about the desired flight track. The radar will be designed to be operable on a UAV (Unpiloted Arial Vehicle) but will initially be demonstrated on a on a NASA Gulfstream III. The radar will be fully polarimetric, with a range bandwidth of 80 MHz (2 m range resolution), and will support a 16 km range swath. The antenna will be electronically steered along track to assure that the antenna beam can be directed independently, regardless of the wind direction and speed. Other features supported by the antenna include elevation monopulse and pulse-to-pulse re-steering capabilities that will enable some novel modes of operation. The system will nominally operate at 45,000 ft (13800 m). The program began as an Instrument Incubator Project (IIP) funded by NASA Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO).},

Techniques have been developed for compensating variations in surface illumination due to topography. The compensation of illumination effects of the optical data is based on calculations of radiative transfer through the atmosphere in combination with digital elevation data. The topographic effects in the SAR data are compensated by the use of a geometric illumination model in combination with angular backscattering functions. Results of classifications of various surface types, including snow cover, glaciers, and alpine vegetation, are shown based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and polarimetric AIRSAR data of a test site in the Austrian Alps. The two sensor types were found to be highly complementary, with TM enabling accurate mapping of slowly changing features such as boundaries of glaciers and vegetated areas. SAR was found superior for monitoring dynamic features like the extent of snow areas and for detecting target characteristics related to dielectric and structural properties.},

  abstract = {Frequent mapping of snow parameters, like snow cover area (SCA) and snow surface wetness (SSW), is important for applications in hydrology, meteorology and climatology. In this study we have developed a few general multi-sensor/timeseries approaches for such monitoring. The objective is to analyze, on a daily basis, a time series of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data together producing sensorindependent products. A few algorithms for multi-sensor/timeseries processing have been developed and are compared in this study. A typical approach is to analyze each image individually and combine them into a day product. How each image contributes to the day products is controlled by a pixel-by-pixel confidence value that is computed for each image analyzed. The confidence algorithm may take into account information about the local observation angle/IFOV size, probability of clouds, prior information about snow state, etc. The time series of day products are then combined into a multi-sensor/multi-temporal product. The combination of products is done on a pixel-by-pixel basis and controlled by each individual product/pixel's confidence and a decay function of time. The ``multi product'' should then represent the most likely status of the monitored variable. The sensors applied in this algorithm study are MODIS for optical data and ENVISAT ASAR for SAR data. The study area is South Norway, and the study focuses on the snowmelt seasons in 2003 and 2004.},

  abstract = {The physical properties of a snowpack strongly influence the emissions from the substratum, making snow property retrievals feasible by means of the surface brightness temperature observed by passive microwave sensors. Depending on the spatial resolution observed, time series records of daily snow coverage and critical snowpack properties such as snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) could be helpful in applications ranging from modelling snow variations for water resources management in a catchment to global climatologic studies. However, the challenge of including spaceborne SWE products in operational hydrological and hydroclimate modelling applications is very demanding with limited uptake by these systems, mostly attributed to insufficient SWE estimation accuracy. The root causes of this challenge include the coarse spatial resolution of passive microwave (PM) observations that observe highly aggregated snowpack properties at the spaceborne scale, and inadequacies during the retrieval process caused by uncertainties with the forward emission modelling of snow and challenges to find robust parameterizations of the models. While the spatial resolution problem is largely in the realm of engineering design and constrained by physical restrictions, a better understanding of developed and adopted retrieval methodologies can provide the clarity needed to enhance our knowledge in this field. In this paper, we review snow depth and SWE retrieval methods using PM observations, taking only dry snow retrieval processes into consideration. Snow properties using PM observations can be modelled by purely empirical relations based on underlying physical processes, and SD and SWE can be estimated by regression-based approaches. Snow property retrievals have been refined gradually throughout four decades use of PM observations in tandem with better understanding of physical processes, inclusion of better snowpack parameterizations, improved uncertainty analysis frameworks, and applying better inversion algorithms. Studying available methods, we conclude that snowpack parameterization is key to accurate retrieval. By improving retrieval algorithm architectures to better capture dynamic snowpack evolution processes, SWE estimates are likely to improve. We conclude that this challenge can be addressed by coupling emission models and land surface models or integrating weather-driven snowpack evolution into emission models and performing inversion in a Bayesian framework.},

Validation efforts show that both pixel-level, fractional snow cover relationships for the Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments work well as quantified by such measures as correlation coefficient (r) and root-mean-square error when compared to Landat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper ground-truth observations covering a substantial range of snow cover conditions. Over all the scenes used herein, the correlation coefficients were near 0.9 and the RMSE near 0.10. However, somewhat better performance was found for the Terra MODIS versus the Aqua MODIS over nearly concurrently observed scenes.

  abstract = {Snow-cover information is important for a wide variety of scientific studies, water supply and management applications. The NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides improved capabilities to observe snow cover from space and has been successfully using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), along with threshold tests, to provide global, automated binary maps of snow cover. The NDSI is a spectral band ratio that takes advantage of the spectral differences of snow in short-wave infrared and visible MODIS spectral bands to identify snow versus other features in a scene. This study has evaluated whether there is a ``signal'' in the NDSI that could be used to estimate the fraction of snow within a 500 m MODIS pixel and thereby enhance the use of the NDSI approach in monitoring snow cover. Using Landsat 30-m observations as ``ground truth,'' the percentage of snow cover was calculated for 500m cells. Then a regression relationship between 500-m NDSI observations and fractional snow cover was developed over three different snowcovered regions and tested over other areas. The overall results indicate that the relationship between fractional snow cover and NDSI is reasonably robust when applied locally and over large areas like North America. The relationship offers advantages relative to other published fractional snow cover algorithms developed for global-scale use with MODIS. This study indicates that the fraction of snow cover within a MODIS pixel using this approach can be provided with a mean absolute error less than 0.1 over the range from 0.0 to 1.0 in fractional snow cover.},

  abstract = {Snow sublimation can be an important component of the snow-cover mass balance, and there is considerable interest in quantifying the role of this process within the water and energy balance of snow-covered regions. In recent years, robust eddy covariance (EC) instrumentation has been used to quantify snow sublimation over snow-covered surfaces in complex mountainous terrain. However, EC can be challenging for monitoring turbulent fluxes in snow-covered environments because of intensive data, power, and fetch requirements, and alternative methods of estimating snow sublimation are often relied upon. To evaluate the relative merits of methods for quantifying surface sublimation, fluxes calculated by the EC, Bowen ratio\textendash energy balance (BR), bulk aerodynamic flux (BF), and aerodynamic profile (AP) methods and their associated uncertainty were compared at two forested openings in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Biases between methods are evaluated over a range of environmental conditions, and limitations of each method are discussed. Mean surface sublimation rates from both sites ranged from 0.33 to 0.36 mm day\`A1, 0.14 to 0.37 mm day\`A1, 0.10 to 0.17 mm day\`A1, and 0.03 to 0.10 mm day\`A1 for the EC, BR, BF and AP methods, respectively. The EC and/or BF methods are concluded to be superior for estimating surface sublimation in snowcovered forested openings. The surface sublimation rates quantified in this study are generally smaller in magnitude compared with previously published studies in this region and help to refine sublimation estimates for forested openings in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

This study combines a process-based snow model (SnowModel) with eddy covariance (EC) measurements to investigate (1) the spatio-temporal variability of simulated snow sublimation with respect to station observations, (2) the contribution of snow sublimation to the ablation of the snowpack, and (3) the sensitivity and response of snow sublimation to bark beetle-induced forest mortality and climate warming across the north-central Colorado Rocky Mountains. EC-based observations of snow sublimation compared well with simulated snow sublimation at stations dominated by surface and canopy sublimation, but blowing snow sublimation in alpine areas was not well captured by the EC instrumentation. Water balance calculations provided an important validation of simulated sublimation at the watershed scale. Simulated snow sublimation across the study area was equivalent to 28\% of winter precipitation on average, and the highest relative snow sublimation fluxes occurred during the lowest snow years. Snow sublimation from forested areas accounted for the majority of sublimation fluxes, highlighting the importance of canopy and sub-canopy surface sublimation in this region. Simulations incorporating the effects of tree mortality due to bark-beetle disturbance resulted in a 4\% reduction in snow sublimation from forested areas. Snow sublimation rates corresponding to climate warming simulations remained unchanged or slightly increased, but total sublimation losses decreased by up to 6\% because of a reduction in snow covered area and duration.},

A key consideration for scaling assimilation to the basin scale is its performance at forested locations\textemdash where canopy-snow interactions affect snow accumulation and melt, yet are difficult to model and parameterize. We implement a particle filter (PF) technique to assimilate intermittent snow depth observations into the Flexible Snow Model, and validate model outputs against snow density and SWE measurements across adjacent forest and open sites, at two locations with different climates and forest structures. Assimilation reduces snow depth error by 70\%\textendash 90\%, density error by 5\%\textendash 30\%, and SWE error by 50\%\textendash 70\% at forest locations (relative to controls). The PF simulates the seasonal evolution of the snowpack under forest canopy, including where interception losses decrease SWE in the forest during accumulation, and shading reduces melt during the ablation season (relative to open sites). Model outputs are sensitive to canopy-related parameters, but DA reduces the range in snow depth and SWE estimates resulting from variations or uncertainties in these parameters by over 50\%. These results demonstrate that the importance of accurately measuring, estimating, or calibrating canopy-related parameters is reduced when snow depth observations are assimilated. Finally, we assimilate remotely sensed snow depth observations at 50 m resolution across the East River Basin, Colorado (1,000 km2). Across elevations, the PF increases estimated precipitation at forested sites by {$\sim$}15\% relative to open sites, likely compensating for excessive sublimation of intercepted snow.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new approach based on modelling and assimilation to combine SAR and optical data for snow cover area mapping. SAR data would typically be acquired a few times a week, while optical data is acquired daily but is limited by cloud cover. The algorithm we use analyses the current time series to estimate the current Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) per pixel. A set of snow states is defined. Each snow state has a corresponding reflectance model for optical data and a backscatter model for SAR data. The snow states defined are `dry snow, full snow cover', `wet snow, full snow cover', `fractional snow cover' and `snow-free ground'. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been established to compute the likelihood of a transition from one state to another, given the current observations. The backscatter and reflectance observations are processed by an algorithm comparing them to their respective models given by the current state. Based on this, the most likely current FSC is calculated for each pixel being analysed. Each pixel is processed independently and might therefore be in different stages (which is typical for mountainous terrain). The approach has been tested for a mountain plateau in South Norway combining Terra MODIS and ENVISAT ASAR from four snowmelt seasons (2003-2006). The results indicate that it is possible to obtain consistent results of high accuracy from the combination of the two sensors.

  abstract = {Automated, reliable cloud masks over snow-covered terrain would improve the retrieval of snow properties from multispectral satellite sensors. The U.S. Geological Survey and NASA chose the currently operational cloud masks based on global performance across diverse land cover types. This study assesses errors in these cloud masks over snow-covered, midlatitude mountains. We use 26 Landsat 8 scenes with manually delineated cloud, snow, and land cover to assess the performance of two cloud masks: CFMask for the Landsat 8 OLI and the cloud mask that ships with Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products MOD09GA and MYD09GA. The overall precision and recall of CFMask over snow-covered terrain are 0.70 and 0.86; the MOD09GA cloud mask precision and recall are 0.17 and 0.72. A plausible reason for poorer performance of cloud masks over snow lies in the potential similarity between multispectral signatures of snow and cloud pixels in three situations: (1) Snow at high elevation is bright enough in the ``cirrus'' bands (Landsat band 9 or MODIS band 26) to be classified as cirrus. (2) Reflectances of ``dark'' clouds in shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands are bracketed by snow spectra in those wavelengths. (3) Snow as part of a fractional mixture in a pixel with soils sometimes produces ``bright SWIR'' pixels that look like clouds. Improvement in snow-cloud discrimination in these cases will require more information than just the spectrum of the sensor's bands or will require deployment of a spaceborne imaging spectrometer, which could discriminate between snow and cloud under conditions where a multispectral sensor might not.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Snow cover mapping algorithms utilizing multispectral satellite data at various spatial resolutions are available, each treating subpixel variation differently. Past evaluations of snow mapping accuracy typically relied on satellite data collected at a higher spatial resolution than the data in question. However, these optical data cannot characterize snow cover mapping performance under forest canopies or at the meter scale. Here, we use 3\,m spatial resolution snow depth maps collected on 116\,d by an aerial laser scanner to validate band ratio and spectral-mixture snow cover mapping algorithms. Such a comprehensive evaluation of sub-canopy snow mapping performance has not been undertaken previously. The following standard (produced operationally by an agency) products are evaluated: NASA gap-filled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1F, NASA gap-filled Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) VNP10A1F, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat~8 Level-3 Fractional Snow Covered Area. Two spectral-unmixing approaches are also evaluated: Snow-Covered Area and Grain Size (SCAG) and Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS), both of which are gap-filled MODIS products and are also run on Landsat~8. We assess subpixel snow mapping performance while considering the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), canopy cover, sensor zenith angle, and other variables within six global seasonal snow classes. Metrics are calculated at the pixel and basin scales, including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias, and F statistic (a detection measure). The newer MOD10A1F Version~61 and VNP10A1F Version~1 product biases (-\,7.1\,\%, -9.5\,\%) improve significantly when linear equations developed for older products are applied (2.8\,\%, -2.7\,\%) to convert band ratios to fSCA. The F statistics are unchanged (94.4\,\%, 93.1\,\%) and the VNP10A1F RMSE improves (18.6\,\% to 15.7\,\%), while the MOD10A1F RMSE worsens (12.7\,\% to 13.7\,\%). Consistent with previous studies, spectral-unmixing approaches (SCAG, SPIReS) show lower biases (-0.1\,\%, -0.1\,\%) and RMSE (12.1\,\%, 12.0\,\%), with higher F statistics (95.6\,\%, 96.1\,\%) relative to the band ratio approaches for MODIS. Landsat~8 products are all spectral-mixture methods with low biases (-0.4\,\% to 0.3\,\%), low RMSE (11.4\,\% to 15.8\,\%), and high F statistics (97.3\,\% to 99.1\,\%). Spectral-unmixing methods can improve snow cover mapping at the global scale.},

When introduced in 1995, the finest-resolution global datasets of these variables were on a 0.58 3 0.58 latitude\textendash longitude grid (approximately 50 km). Here we revisit the snow classification system and, using new datasets and methods, present a revised classification on a 10-arc-s 3 10-arc-s latitude\textendash longitude grid (approximately 300 m). We downscaled 0.18 3 0.18 latitude\textendash longitude (approximately 10 km) gridded meteorological climatologies [1981\textendash 2019, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis, 5th Generation Land (ERA5-Land)] using MicroMet, a spatially distributed, high-resolution, micrometeorological model. The resulting air temperature and precipitation datasets were combined with European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) GlobCover land-cover data (as a surrogate for wind speed) to produce the updated classification, which we have applied to all of Earth's terrestrial areas. We describe this new, high-resolution snow classification dataset, highlight the improvements added to the classification system since its inception, and discuss the utility of the climatological snow classes at this much higher resolution.

  abstract = {Abstract A new classification system for seasonal snow covers is proposed. It has six classes (tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, prairie, and ephemeral, each class defined by a unique ensemble of textural and stratigraphic characteristics including the sequence of snow layers, their thickness, density, and the crystal morphology and grain characteristics within each layer. The classes can also be derived using a binary system of three climate variables: wind, precipitation, and air temperature. Using this classification system, the Northern Hemisphere distribution of the snow cover classes is mapped on a 0.5\textdegree{} lat \texttimes{} 0.5\textdegree{} long grid. These maps are compared to maps prepared from snow cover data collected in the former Soviet Union and Alaska. For these areas where both climatologically based and texturally based snow cover maps are available, there is 62\% and 90\% agreement, respectively. Five of the six snow classes are found in Alaska. From 1989 through 1992, hourly measurements, consisting of 40 thermal and physical parameters, including snow depth, the temperature distribution in the snow, and basal heat flow, were made on four of these classes. In addition, snow stratigraphy and texture were measured every six weeks. Factor analysis indicates that the snow classes can be readily discriminated using four or more winter average thermal or physical parameters. Further, analysis of hourly time series indicates that 84\% of the time, spot measurements of the parameters are sufficient to correctly differentiate the snow cover class. Using the new snow classification system, 1) classes can readily be distinguished using observations of simple thermal parameters, 2) physical and thermal attributes of the snow can be inferred, and 3) classes can be mapped from climate data for use in regional and global climate modeling.},

  abstract = {Snow is a critical water resource for the western United States and many regions across the globe. However, our ability to accurately measure and monitor changes in snow mass from satellite remote sensing, specifically its water equivalent, remains a challenge. To confront these challenges, NASA initiated the SnowEx program, a multiyear effort to address knowledge gaps in snow remote sensing. During SnowEx 2020, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) team acquired an L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data time series to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of repeat-pass L-band InSAR for tracking changes in snow water equivalent (SWE). The goal was to develop a more comprehensive understanding of where and when L-band InSAR can provide SWE change estimates, allowing the snow community to leverage the upcoming NASA\textendash ISRO (NASA\textendash Indian Space Research Organization) SAR (NISAR) mission. Our study analyzed three InSAR image pairs from the Jemez Mountains, NM, between 12 and 26 February 2020. We developed a snow-focused multi-sensor method that uses UAVSAR InSAR data synergistically with optical fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) information. Combining these two remote sensing datasets allows for atmospheric correction and delineation of snow-covered pixels within the radar swath. For all InSAR pairs, we converted phase change values to SWE change estimates between the three acquisition dates. We then evaluated InSAR-derived retrievals using a combination of fSCA, snow pits, meteorological station data, in situ snow depth sensors, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The results of this study show that repeat-pass L-band InSAR is effective for estimating both snow accumulation and ablation with the proper measurement timing, reference phase, and snowpack conditions.},

In contrast, only recently has the application of spaceborne active microwave instruments been investigated for remote sensing of snow on a global scale. This raises the question of whether a technique combining active and passive microwave data can improve the mapping of snow parameters with respect to techniques based solely on passive data. In this letter, we report results concerning the mapping of snow-covered area (SCA) in the Northern Hemisphere between the years 2000 and 2004 derived from the combination of the brightness temperatures at 19.35 and 37 GHz measured by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Radiometer with backscatter coefficients at 13.4 GHz measured by the NASA's QuickSCAT. SCA derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used as a reference to evaluate the performance of the microwave-based techniques and their combination. Results show that, generally, the technique using passive data provides better agreement with MODIS SCA than the technique using only scatterometer data. However, the results when both datasets are used show considerable improvement, demonstrating the potential benefits of a multisensor approach},

  abstract = {The extent and duration of snow cover, a critical component of the hydrologic cycle and the global climate system, is expected to shift dramatically under climate change. Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snow-covered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of F-scores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snow-related processes.},

As snow cover can vary significantly within short time spans and often extends over vast areas, spaceborne remote sensing constitutes an efficient observation technique to track it continuously. However, as optical imagery is limited by cloud cover and polar darkness, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) attracted more attention for its ability to sense day-and-night under any cloud and weather condition. In addition to widely applied backscattering-based method, thanks to the advancements of spaceborne SAR sensors and image processing techniques, many new approaches based on interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have been developed since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991 to monitor snow cover under both dry and wet snow conditions. Critical auxiliary data including DEM, land cover information, and local meteorological data have also been explored to aid the snow cover analysis.

  abstract = {Traditional studies on mapping wet snow cover extent (SCE) often feature limitations, especially in vegetated and mountainous areas. The aim of this study is to propose a new total and wet SCE mapping strategy based on freely accessible spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The approach is transferable on a global scale as well as for different land cover types (including densely vegetated forest and agricultural regions), and is based on the use of backscattering coefficient, interferometric SAR coherence, and polarimetric parameters. Furthermore, four topographical factors were included in the simple tuning of random forest-based land cover type-dependent classification strategy. Results showed the classification accuracy was above 0.75, with an F-measure higher than 0.70, in all five selected regions of interest located around globally distributed mountain ranges. Whilst excluding forest-type land cover classes, the accuracy and F-measure increases to 0.80 and 0.75. In cross-location model set, the accuracy can also be maintained at 0.80 with non-forest accuracy up to 0.85. It has been found that the elevation and polarimetric parameters are the most critical factors, and that the quality of land cover information would also affect the subsequent mapping reliability. In conclusion, through comprehensive validation using optical satellite and in-situ data, our land cover-dependent total SCE mapping approach has been confirmed to be robustly applicable, and the holistic SCE map for different months were eventually derived.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 \texttimes{} 106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate ({$\sim$} -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.},

  abstract = {Aim For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing-derived land-cover products have limitations due to among-product inconsistency and their typically non-continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1-km resolution global product that provides scale-integrated and accuracy-weighted consensus land-cover information on an approximately continuous scale. Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Recently, with the extensive availability of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, methods that are simple and efficient, and involve lesser computation and data processing, are needed to be explored for snow cover mapping. This paper analyzes different polarimetric parameters such as entropy, anisotropy, and the mean scattering angle for the identification of snow cover area. We present a novel index for mapping snow cover based on the assessment of entropy (H) and anisotropy (A) using fully polarimetric SAR data and refer to it as the radar snow fraction (RSF). The RSF is proposed as an extension of the H(1-A) metric by applying a sigmoidal function to this metric. The experiments to evaluate the applicability of the proposed RSF are carried out using fully polarimetric SAR data of L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and C-band RADARSAT-2 data sets corresponding to different geographical locations in the Indian Himalayas. The developed snow cover maps from the proposed method were validated with respect to reference snow cover maps derived by thresholding the Normalized Differenced Snow Index developed from multispectral data (e.g., Landsat-8 imagery). These maps were also statistically compared with those obtained from the conventional radar snow index, which is based on the polarization fraction. We determined a mean overall accuracy of 0.8 between the developed snow cover maps and the reference maps for the different data sets used for experiments. The results showed that, in general, the RSF outperformed the other polarimetric parameters for snow cover detection. Plain Language Summary Fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data are widely used for the studies of snow geophysical parameters requiring good quality snow cover area (SCA) maps. There are limited methods in the literature for SCA mapping using fully PolSAR data. Some of these methods are based on multitemporal backscatter response, which requires more data sets that are commercial and expensive; efforts toward the development of methods, which can discriminate snow using a single data sets, are desirable. This study examines the potential of the proposed radar snow fraction (RSF) index, which is based on fully polarimetric SAR data utilizing the response of entropy (H) and anisotropy (A) for snow cover mapping. The parameter RSF is an extension of the H(1-A) metric, which utilizes a sigmoidal filter function to this metric. The proposed method, the conventional radar snow index (RSI), and the other polarimetric parameters are evaluated for SCA mapping for different L-band and C-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and RADARSAT-2 data sets for rugged terrains in various locations in the Indian Himalayas. This study also compared the RSF with RSI for SCA mapping and delineated better results for the RSF.},

Supported by data from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the National Elevation Dataset (NED), the LANDFIRE project, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001, this paper describes a data fusion and modeling strategy for developing the first-ever high-resolution map of canopy height for the conterminous U.S. The approach was tested as part of a prototype study spanning some 62,000 km2 in central Utah (NLCD mapping zone 16). A mapping strategy based on objectoriented image analysis and tree-based regression techniques is employed. Empirical model development is driven by a database of height metrics obtained from an extensive field plot network administered by the USDA Forest Service\textendash Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Based on data from 508 FIA field plots, an average absolute height error of 2.1 m (r = 0.88) was achieved for the prototype mapping zone.},

  abstract = {Mountain snowpack provides critical water resources for forest and meadow ecosystems that are experiencing rapid change due to global warming. An accurate characterization of snowpack heterogeneity in these ecosystems requires snow cover observations at high spatial resolutions, yet most existing snow cover datasets have a coarse resolution. To advance our observation capabilities of snow cover in meadows and forests, we developed a machine learning model to generate snow-covered area (SCA) maps from PlanetScope imagery at about 3-m spatial resolution. The model achieves a median F1 score of 0.75 for 103 cloud-free images across four different sites in the Western United States and Switzerland. It is more accurate (F1 score = 0.82) when forest areas are excluded from the evaluation. We further tested the model performance across 7,741 mountain meadows at the two study sites in the Sierra Nevada, California. It achieved a median F1 score of 0.83, with higher accuracy for larger and simpler geometry meadows than for smaller and more complexly shaped meadows. While mapping SCA in regions close to or under forest canopy is still challenging, the model can accurately identify SCA for relatively large forest gaps (i.e., 15m {$<$} DCE {$<$} 27m), with a median F1 score of 0.87 across the four study sites, and shows promising accuracy for areas very close ({$>$}10m) to forest edges. Our study highlights the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery for mapping mountain snow cover in forested areas and meadows, with implications for advancing ecohydrological research in a world expecting significant changes in snow.},

  abstract = {A model for the remote sensing of snow water equivalent (SWE) using coherent detection of reflected communication satellite ``signals of opportunity'' is described in this paper. We modeled the snowpack by a layered medium and compute the phase of specularly reflected signals from the snowpack. Phase change of the reflected signal is predicted to be strongly dependent on SWE for dry snow and on snow depth for wet snow. Phase sensitivity to SWE increases with frequency. Reflected signals with frequencies above S-band, however, will experience rapid phase wrapping (360\textdegree{} change) and become more susceptible to fringe washing due to spatial variability of SWE across the footprint. We also examined the impact of snow grain size, snow density, snow layering, ground surface scattering, and incoherent scattering from ice grains embedded in the snowpack, concluding that these factors do not have a substantial impact on the phase-SWE relationship. However, the snow wetness of more than a few percent can make the reflection from air-snow interface dominant, leading to a correlation between phase change and snow depth. To address the path delay due to the ionosphere, dual-frequency observations would have to be considered. Modeling analysis indicates that the coherent change detection is a promising technique for remote sensing of SWE.},

The design focuses on the forward-looking geometry near the specular direction, which allows a high surface reflectivity, in order to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a moderate receiving antenna gain. The sparse array is utilized to sharpen the across-track resolution and reduce the iso-range ambiguity. The formulation for match filtering and illustrations of point target response are presented. This work shows that an array of five to seven receivers is able to achieve an across-track resolution of about 200 m in the outer portion of swath and about 1 km in the center part of swath. The along-track resolution can reach 10 m or better due to the feasibility of a long dwell time for Doppler filtering. We find that the sparse array allows the reduction of the iso-range ambiguity to a level of lower than 5\% for a major portion of swath, 70\% or greater depending on the number of receivers and spacing. We have completed an SNR formulation, which can consistently account for both coherent and incoherent scattering regardless the spatial resolution. An analysis of SNR based on the Kirchhoff approximation for rough surface scattering has been performed. We find that it is possible to obtain a swath width of 100 km with an SNR of 5 dB or better for a constellation of seven satellites with a receiving antenna directivity of 15 dBi at a LEO altitude of 675 km for a wide range of surface roughness. Our study suggests the promise of the SoOpSAR concept for high-resolution remote sensing of land surfaces.},

The dense media are computer-generated by applying the bicontinuous random media characterization. The microstructure of the media is controlled by two parameters: mean grain size \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash zeta \textbackslash rangle \$ and aggregation parameter \$b\$ . Phase matrices and extinction coefficients are computed with full-wave simulations. These are then substituted into radiative transfer (RT) equations to obtain backscattering coefficients of the dense media layer with particle clusters. The backscattering has a weaker frequency dependence (e.g., \$\textbackslash sim \$ 2.6 power for \$b=\textbackslash mathbf 0.\textbackslash mathbf 4\$ ) than the Rayleigh scattering of fourth power. Backscattering results exhibit strong co-, cross-polarization (pol), and ratio of cross- to co-polarization. For applications to remote sensing of terrestrial snow at C-band, the results of DMRT simulations show that cross-polarization of snow volume scattering can be larger than that of soil surface scattering. Recently, this property of strong cross-polarization has become a useful satellite remote sensing technique for global retrieval of snow depth. Comparisons of DMRT results are made with ESA Satellite Sentinel 1 C-band data and ground-based radar observations. The calculated backscatter is in good agreement with radar measurements for both the co- and cross-polarization.},

  abstract = {The microwave emission of snow has distinctive, frequency-dependent characteristics that enable the use of passive microwave remote sensing for the detection of (dry) snow alongside the study of further snow properties. Passive microwave approaches for the retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) often implement dry snow detection as one of the main processing steps. Reliable dry snow detection is thus crucial; however, common algorithms tend to underestimate snow cover extent. This study conducts a long-term assessment of six dry snow detection algorithms as part of ongoing GlobSnow SWE product development. We focus on terrestrial snow on the Northern Hemisphere, using exhaustive in situ snow depth measurements and spatially complete snow maps by the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). In addition to using conventional daily snow masks, cumulative snow masks are investigated as means to counteract underestimation and the results emphasise their potential for this purpose. Best performances are achieved by the cumulative versions of the algorithm of the EUMETSAT H SAF H11 product and of the decision tree by Grody and Basist (1996), which agree with in situ data by approximately 81\% and 84\% whilst differing from IMS maps by only about 15\% and 11\%, respectively. Their validation for hemispheric SWE retrieval in the GlobSnow framework, using in situ snow course SWE observations, shows a noticeable improvement of the current statistics especially during shallow snow conditions in autumn\textemdash reducing the bias by up to 2.2 mm and the RMSE by up to 2.0 mm. This highlights the impact that the algorithm choice for dry snow detection has on the quality of SWE retrieval and therefore on long-term climate data records.},
