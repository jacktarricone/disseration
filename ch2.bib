  abstract = {Landscape-scale ecological modelling has been hindered by suitable high-resolution surface meteorological datasets. To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.

  abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000\textendash 2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({$>$}1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984\textendash 2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

  abstract = {The widespread decrease in mountain snowpack across the Western United States is a hallmark indicator of regional climate change. Observed decreases in snowpack across lower-elevation watersheds are broadly consistent with model predictions of anthropogenic climate change; however, the magnitude of the decreases across much of the Cascades, Northern Rockies and Sierra Nevada has exceeded predictions based solely on late 20th century anthropogenic warming. To resolve the disparity between observations and predictions, the influence of intramonthly variability associated with the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern on both the percent of precipitation falling as snow and a proxy for snowmelt during late winter is examined. The PNA is shown to have a significant influence on the elevation of the freezing level across the Western United States, with positive values of the PNA generally associated with anomalously high freezing levels. The positive tendency of the PNA during late winter over the last half-century has contributed to regional increases in the elevation of the freezing level, decreases in the percent of precipitation falling as snow, and increases in snowmelt across montane and sub-montane regions. This change in atmospheric circulation accelerated the decline in mountain snowpack predicted by anthropogenic forcing. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Here, we demonstrate that while there have been widespread increases in fire danger across the mountainous western US from 1979 to 2020, trends were most acute at high-elevation regions above 3000\,m. The greatest increase in the number of days conducive to large fires occurred at 2500\textendash 3000\,m, adding 63 critical fire danger days between 1979 and 2020. This includes 22 critical fire danger days occurring outside the warm season (May\textendash September). Furthermore, our findings indicate increased elevational synchronization of fire danger in western US mountains, which can facilitate increased geographic opportunities for ignitions and fire spread that further complicate fire management operations. We hypothesize that several physical mechanisms underpinned the observed trends, including elevationally disparate impacts of earlier snowmelt, intensified land-atmosphere feedbacks, irrigation, and aerosols, in addition to widespread warming/drying.},

A fully standardized and global multivariate product of different terrain features has the potential to support many large-scale research applications, however to date, such datasets are unavailable. Here we used the digital elevation model products of global 250\,m GMTED2010 and near-global 90\,m SRTM4.1dev to derive a suite of topographic variables: elevation, slope, aspect, eastness, northness, roughness, terrain roughness index, topographic position index, vector ruggedness measure, profile/tangential curvature, first/second order partial derivative, and 10 geomorphological landform classes. We aggregated each variable to 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100\,km spatial grains using several aggregation approaches. While a cross-correlation underlines the high similarity of many variables, a more detailed view in four mountain regions reveals local differences, as well as scale variations in the aggregated variables at different spatial grains.

  abstract = {Snow albedo is a dominant control on snowmelt in many parts of the world. An empirical albedo decay equation, developed over 60 years ago, is still used in snowmelt models. Several empirical snow albedo models developed since show wide spread in results. Remotely sensed snow albedos have been used in a few studies, but validations are scarce because of the difficulty in making accurate in situ measurements. Reconstruction of snow water equivalent (SWE), where the snowpack is built in reverse, is especially sensitive to albedo. We present two new contributions: (1) an updated albedo model where grain size and light absorbing particle content are solved for simultaneously and (2) multiyear comparisons of remotely sensed and in situ albedo measurements from three high-altitude sites in the western United States. Our remotely sensed albedos show 4 to 6\% RMSE and negligible bias. In comparison, empirical albedo decay models, which require extensive in situ measurements, show RMSE values of 7 to 17\% with biases of -6 to -14\%. We examine the sensitivity of SWE reconstructions to albedo error at two sites. With no simulated error in albedo, reconstructed SWE had MAE values of 7 to 13\% and 5\textendash 6\% bias. The accuracy actually improved with some simulated added error, likely because of a fundamental bias in the reconstruction approach. Conversely, the best age-based decay model showed an 18\textendash 20\% MAE and bias in reconstructed SWE. We conclude that remotely sensed albedos where available are superior to age-based approaches in all aspects except simplicity.},

  abstract = {A multiresolution (MR) approach was successfully implemented in the context of a data assimilation (DA) framework to efficiently estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) over a large head water catchment in the Colorado River basin (CRB), while decreasing computational constraints by 60 \%. A total of 31 years of fractional snow cover area (fSCA) images derived from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI sensor measurements were assimilated to generate two SWE reanalysis datasets, a baseline case at a uniform 90 m spatial resolution and another using the MR approach. A comparison of the two showed negligible differences in terms of snow accumulation, melt, and timing for the posterior estimates (in terms of both ensemble median and coefficient of variation). The MR approach underestimated the baseline peak SWE by less than 2 \% and underestimated day of peak and duration of the accumulation season by a day on average. The largest differences were, by construct, limited primarily to areas of low complexity, where shallow snowpacks tend to exist. The MR approach should allow for more computationally efficient implementations of snow data assimilation applications over large-scale mountain ranges, with accuracies similar to those that would be obtained using {$\sim$} 100 m simulations. Such uniform resolution applications are generally infeasible due to the computationally expensive nature of ensemble-based DA frameworks.},

We envision an integrative approach to monitoring, modeling, and sensing the mountain environment that will improve understanding and prediction of hydrologic fluxes and processes. Here extensive monitoring of energy fluxes and hydrologic states are needed to supplement existing measurements, which are largely limited to streamflow and snow water equivalent. Ground-based observing systems must be explicitly designed for integration with remotely sensed data and for scaling up to basins and whole ranges.},

  abstract = {Summer streamflow variations strongly affect water supply reliability and ecological functioning of western U.S. (WUS) streams. Traditional snow-based forecasts of summer streamflow are becoming less accurate with warming-induced reductions in winter snow accumulation. This reflects a rising importance of competing runoff-generating processes in controlling summer streamflow variations, primarily an increasing role of rainfall in contrast to snowmelt. Here, based on a snowmelt-rainfall tracking algorithm applied to two hydrological models, we show that cool-season rainfall provides an important volumetric contribution to summer streamflow for many WUS streams in the current climate, and this contribution will increase under climate warming, especially in years with warm snow droughts and abnormally dry summers. We also show that seasonal rainfall (warm-/cool-seasons) dominates the variability of summer streamflow across {$\sim$}70\% area of WUS. We show that an increasing warm-season rainfall contribution to summer streamflow (largely replacing snowmelt) results in reduced summer streamflow predictability.},

We present a possible mechanism linking snowmelt rate and streamflow generation using a gridded implementation of the Budyko framework. We computed an ensemble of Budyko streamflow anomalies (BSAs) using Variable Infiltration Capacity model-simulated evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and estimated precipitation at 1/16\textdegree{} resolution from 1950 to 2013. BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r2 = 0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r2 = 0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The spatial distribution of snow plays a vital role in sub-Arctic and Arctic climate, hydrology, and ecology due to its fundamental influence on the water balance, thermal regimes, vegetation, and carbon flux. However, the spatial distribution of snow is not well understood, and therefore, it is not well modeled, which can lead to substantial uncertainties in snow cover representations. To capture key hydro-ecological controls on snow spatial distribution, we carried out intensive field studies over multiple years for two small (2017\textendash 2019; {$\sim$}\,2.5\,km2) sub-Arctic study sites located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Using an intensive suite of field observations ({$>$}\,22\,000~data points), we developed simple models of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) using factors such as topographic characteristics, vegetation characteristics based on greenness (normalized different vegetation index, NDVI), and a simple metric for approximating winds. The most successful model was random forest, using both study sites and all years, which was able to accurately capture the complexity and variability of snow characteristics across the sites. Approximately 86\,\% of the SWE distribution could be accounted for, on average, by the random forest model at the study sites. Factors that impacted year-to-year snow distribution included NDVI, elevation, and a metric to represent coarse microtopography (topographic position index, TPI), while slope, wind, and fine microtopography factors were less important. The characterization of the SWE spatial distribution patterns will be used to validate and improve snow distribution modeling in the Department of Energy's Earth system model and for improved understanding of hydrology, topography, and vegetation dynamics in the sub-Arctic and Arctic regions of the globe.},

  abstract = {Many forested mountain watersheds worldwide evolved with frequent fire, which Twentieth Century fire suppression activities eliminated, resulting in unnaturally dense forests with high water demand. Restoration of pre-suppression forest composition and structure through a variety of management activities could improve forest resilience and water yields. This study explores the potential for ``managed wildfire'', whereby naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn, to alter the water balance. Interest in this type of managed wildfire is increasing, yet its long-term effects on water balance are uncertain. We use soil moisture as a spatially-distributed hydrologic indicator to assess the influence of vegetation, fire history and landscape position on water availability in the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park. Over 6000 manual surface soil moisture measurements were made over a period of three years, and supplemented with continuous soil moisture measurements over the top 1m of soil in three sites. Random forest and linear mixed effects models showed a dominant effect of vegetation type and history of vegetation change on measured soil moisture. Contemporary and historical vegetation maps were used to upscale the soil moisture observations to the basin and infer soil moisture under fire-suppressed conditions. Little change in basin-averaged soil moisture was inferred due to managed wildfire, but the results indicated that large localized increases in soil moisture had occurred, which could have important impacts on local ecology or downstream flows.},

  abstract = {Snow and hydrological modeling in alpine environments remains challenging because of the complexity of the processes affecting the mass and energy balance. This study examines the influence of snowmelt on the hydrological response of a high-alpine catchment of 43.2 km2 in the Swiss Alps during the water year 2014\textendash 2015. Based on recent advances in Alpine3D, we examine how snow distributions and liquid water transport within the snowpack influence runoff dynamics. By combining these results with multiscale observations (snow lysimeter, distributed snow depths, and streamflow), we demonstrate the added value of a more realistic snow distribution at the onset of melt season. At the site scale, snowpack runoff is well simulated when the mass balance errors are corrected (R2 = 0.95 versus R2 = 0.61). At the subbasin scale, a more heterogeneous snowpack leads to a more rapid runoff pulse originating in the shallower areas while an extended melting period (by a month) is caused by snowmelt from deeper areas. This is a marked improvement over results obtained using a traditional precipitation interpolation method. Hydrological response is also improved by the more realistic snowpack (NSE of 0.85 versus 0.74), even though calibration processes smoothen out the differences. The added value of a more complex liquid water transport scheme is obvious at the site scale but decreases at larger scales. Our results highlight not only the importance but also the difficulty of getting a realistic snowpack distribution even in a well-instrumented area and present a model validation from multiscale experimental data sets.},

These surveys provide rich information about snow depth, but they are usually not accompanied with spatially explicit measurements of snow density, which leads to uncertainty in the estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE). In this study, we use a novel approach to distribute 300 field measurements of snow density with artificial neural networks. We combine the resulting density maps with aerial lidar snow depth measurements, bias corrected with a very large and precisely geolocated array of field-measured snow depths ( 4,000 observations), to create and validate maps of snow depth, snow density, and SWE over two sites along Arizona's Mogollon Rim in February and March 2017. These maps show differences between midwinter and late-winter snow conditions. In particular, compared to that of snow depth, the spatial variability of snow density is smaller for the later snow survey than the earlier snow survey. These gridded data also show that the representativeness of Snow Telemetry and other point measurements is different for the midwinter and late-winter snow surveys. Overall, the lidar artificial neural network SWE estimates can be as much as 30\% different than if Snow Telemetry density were used with lidar snow depths to estimate SWE.},

  abstract = {Higher global temperatures and intensification of extreme hydrologic events, such as droughts, can lead to premature tree mortality. In a Mediterranean climate like California, the seasonality of precipitation is out of sync with the peak growing season. Seasonal snowpack plays a critical role in reducing this mismatch between the timing of water input to the root zone and the peak forest water use. A loss of snowpack, or snow droughts, during warmer years, increases the asynchrony between water inputs and the peak of forest water use, intensifying water stress and tree mortality. Therefore, we hypothesize that the montane vegetation response to interannual climate variability in a Mediterranean climate is regulated by the snowpack. We tested this hypothesis using the 2012\textendash 2015 drought as a natural experiment. Regional Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to infer and quantify the role of snowpack on forest water stress. The models simulate the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) as a proxy of forest water stress using water deficit (as seasonality index), location, slope, and aspect. The GAMs were trained using 75\% of the data between 2001 and 2014. The remaining 25\% of the data were used for validation. The model was able to simulate forest water stress for 2015 and 2016 across the northern, central, and southern Sierra Nevada with a range of R2 between 0.80 and 0.84. The simulated spatial patterns in forest water stress were consistent with those captured by the USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection Survey. Our findings suggest that the failure of a reduced snowpack in mitigating water deficit exacerbates forest water stress and tree mortality. Variations in water and surface energy budget across an elevational gradient play a critical role in modulating the vegetation response. These results provide insights into the importance of the Sierra Nevada snowpack under a warming climate. The models can aid forest managers to identify future forest water stress and tree die-off patterns.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a data assimilation method that uses observations of snow covered area (SCA) to update hydrologic model states in a mountainous catchment in Colorado. The assimilation method uses SCA information as part of an ensemble Kalman filter to alter the sub-basin distribution of snow as well as the basin water balance. This method permits an optimal combination of model simulations and observations, as well as propagation of information across model states. Sensitivity experiments are conducted with a fairly simple snowpack/water-balance model to evaluate effects of the data assimilation scheme on simulations of streamflow. The assimilation of SCA information results in minor improvements in the accuracy of streamflow simulations near the end of the snowmelt season. The small effect from SCA assimilation is initially surprising. It can be explained both because a substantial portion of snowmelts before any bare ground is exposed, and because the transition from 100\% to 0\% snow coverage occurs fairly quickly. Both of these factors are basin-dependent. Satellite SCA information is expected to be most useful in basins where snow cover is ephemeral. The data assimilation strategy presented in this study improved the accuracy of the streamflow simulation, indicating that SCA is a useful source of independent information that can be used as part of an integrated data assimilation strategy.},

The RKT is a robust, nonparametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The RKT analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2\textendash 3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. RKT analyses also indicated that November\textendash May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.98C decade21, while 1 April SWE and maximum SWE declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade21, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45\% of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78\% of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and SWE explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for SWE, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year.},

We used a spatially distributed snowpack energy balance model to simulate the sensitivity of multiple snowpack metrics to a +2 \textdegree C and +4 \textdegree C warming and compared our modeled sensitivities to observed values during 2014 and 2015. We found that for each +1 \textdegree C warming, modeled basin-mean peak snow water equivalent (SWE) declined by 22\%\textendash 30\%, the date of peak SWE (DPS) advanced by 13 days, the duration of snow cover (DSC) shortened by 31\textendash 34 days, and the snow disappearance date (SDD) advanced by 22\textendash 25 days. Our hypothesis was not borne out by the observations except in the case of peak SWE; other snow metrics did not resemble predicted values based on modeled sensitivities and thus are not effective analogs of future temperature sensitivities.

Snowy regions are typically data sparse, especially in mountain environments. Remotely-sensed snow cover data are available globally but are challenging to convert into accessible, actionable information. SnowCloudMetrics is a web portal for on-demand production and delivery of snow information including snow cover frequency (SCF) and snow disappearance date (SDD) using Google Earth Engine (GEE). SCF and SDD are computed using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Cover Binary 500 m (MOD10A1) product. The SCF and SDD metrics are assessed using 18 years of Snow Telemetry records at more than 750 stations across the Western U.S. SnowCloudMetrics provides users with the capacity to quickly and efficiently generate local-to-global scale snow information. It requires no user-side data storage or computing capacity, and needs little in the way of remote sensing expertise. SnowCloudMetrics allows users to subset by year, watershed, elevation range, political boundary, or user-defined region. Users can explore the snow information via a GEE map interface and, if desired, download scripts for access to tabular and image data in non-proprietary formats for additional analyses. We present global and hemispheric scale examples of SCF and SDD. We also provide a watershed example in the transboundary, snow-dominated Amu Darya Basin. Our approach represents a new, user-driven paradigm for access to snow information. SnowCloudMetrics benefits snow scientists, water resource managers, climate scientists, and snow related industries providing SCF and SDD information tailored to their needs, especially in data sparse regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the late 1940s, snowmelt and runoff have come increasingly early in the water year in many basins in northern and central California. This subtle trend is most pronounced in moderate-altitude basins, which are sensitive to changes in mean winter temperatures. Such basins have broad areas in which winter temperatures are near enough to freezing that small increases result initially in the formation of less snow and eventually in early snowmelt. In moderate-altitude basins of California, a declining fraction of the annual runoff has come in April\textendash June. This decline has been compensated by increased fractions of runoff at other, mostly earlier, times in the water year. Weather stations in central California, including the central Sierra Nevada, have shown trends toward warmer winters since the 1940s. A series of regression analyses indicate that runoff timing responds equally to the observed decadal-scale trends in winter temperature and interannual temperature variations of the same magnitude, suggesting that the temperature trend is sufficient to explain the runoff-timing trends. The immediate cause of the trend toward warmer winters in California is a concurrent, long-term fluctuation in winter atmospheric circulations over the North Pacific Ocean and North America that is not immediately distinguishable from natural atmospheric variability. The fluctuation began to affect California in the 1940s, when the region of strongest low-frequency variation of winter circulations shifted to a part of the central North Pacific Ocean that is teleconnected to California temperatures. Since the late 1940s, winter wind fields have been displaced progressively southward over the central North Pacific and northward over the west coast of North America. These shifts in atmospheric circulations are associated with concurrent shifts in both West Coast air temperatures and North Pacific sea surface temperatures.},

  abstract = {The structure of the critical zone (CZ) is a product of feedbacks among hydrologic, climatic, biotic, and chemical processes. Past research within snow-dominated systems has shown that aspect-dependent solar radiation inputs can produce striking differences in vegetation composition, topography, and soil depth between opposing hillslopes. However, far fewer studies have evaluated the role of microclimates on CZ development within rain-dominated systems, especially below the soil and into weathered bedrock. To address this need, we characterized the CZ of a north-facing and south-facing slope within a first-order headwater catchment located in central coast California. We combined terrain analysis of vegetation distribution and topography with soil pit characterization, geophysical surveys and hydrologic measurements between slope-aspects. We documented denser vegetation and higher shallow soil moisture on north facing slopes, which matched previously documented observations in snow-dominated sites. However, average topographic gradients were 24\textdegree{} and saprolite thickness was approximately 6 m across both hillslopes, which did not match common observations from the literature that showed widespread asymmetry in snow-dominated systems. These results suggest that dominant processes for CZ evolution are not necessarily transferable across regions. Thus, there is a continued need to expand CZ research, especially in rain-dominated and water-limited systems. Here, we present two non-exclusive mechanistic hypotheses that may explain these unexpected similarities in slope and saprolite thickness between hillslopes with opposing aspects.},

A linear optimization scheme was used to derive SCA estimates that preserve the statistical moments of the higher spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) ETM+ data and resolve the superior temporal signal (i.e. {$\sim$} daily) of the MODIS data. It was found that merging the two SCA products led to an 8\% decrease and an 18\% increase in the basinwide SWE in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared to the SWE estimated from ETM+ only. Relative to SWE simulations using only ETM+ data, the hybrid SCA estimates reduced the mean absolute SWE error by 17 and 84\% in 2001 and 2002, respectively; errors were determined using intensive snow survey data and two separate methods of scaling snow survey field measurements of SWE to the 1-km model pixel resolution. SWE bias for both years was reduced by 49\% and skewness was reduced from -0.78 to 0.49. These results indicate that the hybrid SWE was closer to being an unbiased estimate of the measured SWE and errors were distributed more normally. The accuracy of the SCA estimates is likely dependent on the vegetation fraction.},

  abstract = {An approach to model distributed snow water equivalence (SWE) that merges field measurements of depth and density with remotely sensed snow-covered area (SCA) is described. In 1993, two teams conducted an intensive snow survey in the 92{$\cdot$}8 km2 Blackcap Basin of the Kings River. Snow depth was measured at 709 points and density in five snow pits and along five transects using a Federal Sampler. Sample locations were chosen to be representative of the range of elevation, slope and aspect of the basin. Regression tree models showed that net radiation, elevation and slope angle account for 60\textendash 70\% of the variance in the depth measurements. Density was distributed over the basin on a 30 m grid with a multiple linear regression model that explained 70\% of the observed variance as a function of the same three variables. The gridded depth estimates, combined with modelled density, produced spatially distributed estimates of SWE. An unsupervised spectral unmixing algorithm estimated snow cover fractions from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data acquired at the time as the snow survey. This method provides a snow cover fraction estimate for every pixel. This subpixel map was used as the best estimate for SCA and, combining it with the SWE map, allowed computation of the SWE volume. The estimated volume using the subpixel SCA map was compared with several SCA maps produced with simulations of binary SCA mapping techniques. Thresholds of 40, 50 and 60\% fractional cover were used to map binary cases of full snow cover or no snow cover. The difference in basin SWE volume was up to 13\% depending on the threshold used to classify snow-covered versus snow-free areas. The percentage differences in volumes show a significant correlation to the percentage differences in SCA between the methods. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A stratified sampling scheme was evaluated by identifying and mapping zones of similar snow properties on the basis of topographic parameters that account for variations in both accumulation and ablation. Elevation, slope, and radiation values calculated from a digital elevation model were used to determine the zones. Of the variables studied, net radiation was of primary importance. Field measurements of SWE were combined with the physical attributes of the watershed and clustered to identify similar classes of SWE. The entire basin was then partitioned into zones for each survey date. Statistical analysis showed that partitioning the watershed on the basis of topographic and radiation variables does produce superior results over a simple random sample.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of snow distribution in the mountains is limited as a result of the complex controls leading to extreme spatial variability. More accurate representations of snow distribution are greatly needed for improvements to hydrological forecasts, climate models, and for the future testing and validation of remote-sensing retrieval algorithms. In this study, the relative performances of four spatial interpolation methods were evaluated to estimate snow water equivalent for three 1 km2 study sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Each study site is representative of different topographic and vegetative characteristics. From 1 to 11 April 2001, 550 snow depth measurements and approximately 16 snow density profiles were obtained within each study site. The analytical methods used to estimate snow depth over the 1 km2 areas were (1) inverse distance weighting, (2) ordinary kriging, (3) modified residual kriging and cokriging, and (4) a combined method using binary regression trees and geostatistical methods. The independent variables used were elevation, slope, aspect, net solar radiation, and vegetation. Using cross-validation procedures, each method was assessed for accuracy. The tree-based models provided the most accurate estimates for all study sites, explaining 18\textendash 30\% of the observed variability in snow depth. Kriging of the regression tree residuals did not substantially improve the models. Cokriging of the residuals resulted in a less accurate model when compared with the tree-based models alone. Binary regression trees may have generated the most accurate estimates out of all methods evaluated; however, substantial portions of the variability in observed snow depth were left unexplained by the models. Though the data may have simply lacked spatial structure, it is recommended that the characteristics of the study sites, sampling strategy, and independent variables be explored further to evaluate the causes for the relatively poor model results.

Atmospheric models, however, generally assume the surface to be flat on subgrid scales. For four areas in North America, ranging in latitude from 39\textdegree N to 69\textdegree N and in topography from rolling to mountainous, we simulate spatial patterns of clear-sky incoming solar radiation. It is found that distributions of slope components and variations in shaded area with solar elevation can be approximated by simple functions that scale to each of the areas studied. From these results, parametrizations are developed for averages, standard deviations, and distributions of direct-beam and diffuse solar radiation. Results from these parametrizations, and from a modified form of a simpler parametrization presented previously, compare well with statistics from the spatial simulations. The only topographic input required by the parametrizations is the standard deviation of slope components; this parameter is again found to have simple scaling relationships with the resolution and extent of the underlying elevation grid and with the standard deviation of elevation.},

  abstract = {This work quantifies the uncertainty of accumulation-season peak snow water storage in the portions of the midlatitude American Cordillera where snow is a dominant driver of hydrology. This is accomplished through intercomparison of commonly used global and regional products over the Western U.S. (WUS) and Andes domains, which have similar 10 hydrometeorology but are disparate with respect to the amount of available in situ information. The recently developed WUS Snow Reanalysis (WUS-SR) and Andes Snow Reanalysis (Andes-SR) datasets, which have been extensively verified against in situ measurements, are used as baseline reference datasets in the intercomparison. Relative to WUS-SR climatological peak SWE storage (269 km3), high- and moderate-resolution products (i.e. those with resolutions less than \textasciitilde 10 km) are in much better agreement (284 {$\pm$} 14 km3; overestimated by 6 \%) compared to low-resolution products (127 km3 {$\pm$} 54 km3; 15 underestimated by 53 \%). In comparison to the Andes-SR peak snow storage (29 km3), all other products show large uncertainty and bias (19 km3 {$\pm$} 16 km3; underestimated by 34 \%). Examination of spatial patterns related to orographic effects, showed that only the high- to moderate-resolution SNODAS and UA products show comparable estimates of windwardleeward SWE patterns over a subdomain (Sierra Nevada) of the WUS. Coarser products distribute too much snow on the leeward side in both the Sierra Nevada and Andes, missing orographic-rainshadow patterns that have important hydrological 20 implications. The uncertainty of peak seasonal snow storage is primarily explained by precipitation uncertainty in both the WUS (R2 = 0.55) and Andes (R2 = 0.84). Despite using similar forcing inputs, snow storage diverges significantly within the ERA5 (i.e. ERA5 vs. ERA5-Land) products and the GLDAS (modeled with Noah, VIC, and Catchment model) products due to resolution-induced elevation differences and/or differing model process representation related to rain\textendash snow partitioning and accumulation-season snowmelt generation. The availability and use of in situ precipitation and snow measurements (i.e., in 25 WUS) in some products adds value by reducing snow storage uncertainty, however where such data are limited, i.e. in the Andes, significant biases and uncertainty exist.},

Over the WUS, the peak SWE verification with independent               in situ               measurements show correlation coefficient, mean difference (MD), and root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.77, -0.15\,m, and 0.28\,m, respectively. The effects of forest cover and Landsat image availability on peak SWE are assessed. WUS\textendash SR peak SWE is well correlated (ranging from 0.75 to 0.91) against independent lidar-derived SWE taken near April 1               st               , with MD {$<$}0.15\,m and RMSD {$<$}0.38\,m. The dataset is useful for characterizing WUS mountain snow storage, and ultimately for improving snow-derived water resources management.},

  abstract = {The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) was launched to the International Space Station on 29 June 2018 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The primary science focus of ECOSTRESS is centered on evapotranspiration (ET), which is produced as Level-3 (L3) latent heat flux (LE) data products. These data are generated from the Level-2 land surface temperature and emissivity product (L2\_LSTE), in conjunction with ancillary surface and atmospheric data. Here, we provide the first validation (Stage 1, preliminary) of the global ECOSTRESS clear-sky ET product (L3\_ET\_PT-JPL, Version 6.0) against LE measurements at 82 eddy covariance sites around the world. Overall, the ECOSTRESS ET product performs well against the site measurements (clear-sky instantaneous/time of overpass: r2 = 0.88; overall bias = 8\%; normalized root-mean-square error, RMSE = 6\%). ET uncertainty was generally consistent across climate zones, biome types, and times of day (ECOSTRESS samples the diurnal cycle), though temperate sites are overrepresented. The 70-m-high spatial resolution of ECOSTRESS improved correlations by 85\%, and RMSE by 62\%, relative to 1-km pixels. This paper serves as a reference for the ECOSTRESS L3 ET accuracy and Stage 1 validation status for subsequent science that follows using these data.},

  abstract = {In snow-dominated mountain regions, a warming climate is expected to alter two drivers of hydrology: (1) decrease the fraction of precipitation falling as snow; and (2) increase surface energy available to drive evapotranspiration. This study uses a novel integrated modeling approach to explicitly separate energy budget increases via warming from precipitation phase transitions from snow to rain in two mountain headwaters transects of the central Rocky Mountains. Both phase transitions and energy increases had significant, though unique, impacts on semi-arid mountain hydrology in our simulations. A complete shift in precipitation from snow to rain reduced streamflow between 11\% and 18\%, while 4 \textdegree C of uniform warming reduced streamflow between 19\% and 23\%, suggesting that changes in energy-driven evaporative loss, between 27\% and 29\% for these uniform warming scenarios, may be the dominant driver of annual mean streamflow in a warming climate. Phase changes induced a flashier system, making water availability more susceptible to precipitation variability and eliminating the runoff signature characteristic of snowmelt-dominated systems. The impact of a phase change on mean streamflow was reduced as aridity increased from west to east of the continental divide.},

We calculated insolation maps from digital elevation models, using an insolation model that accounts for atmospheric conditions, elevation, surface orientation, and influences of surrounding topography. Herein, we focus on the application of this insolation model for spatial interpolation of soil temperature measurements over complex topography at landscape scales. Existing interpolation techniques generally apply only at continental or broad regional scales and do not capture the high variation of finer scales. In our field study in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, average soil temperature was correlated with insolation and elevation. Whereas daily minimum temperature was negatively correlated with elevation (r0/(/0.730, P B/0.05), daily temperature change (maximum minus minimum) was positively correlated with daily insolation (r 0/0.504, P B/0.01). We generated daily minimum and maximum soil temperature maps based on regression analyses. Residual variation was explained by factors such as vegetation cover. This application demonstrates the importance of characterizing spatial and temporal variation of insolation for studies of energy and water balance.},

Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 10\textendash 20\% loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the region's snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60\% is projected within the next 30 years. Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability. The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region.},

  abstract = {In the winter-wet, summer-dry forests of the western United States, total annual evapotranspiration (ET) varies with precipitation and temperature. Geologically mediated drainage and storage properties, however, may strongly influence these relationships between climate and ET. We use a physically based process model to evaluate how plant accessible water storage capacity (AWC) and rates of drainage influence model estimates of ET\textendash climate relationships for three snow-dominated, mountainous catchments with differing precipitation regimes. Model estimates show that total annual precipitation is a primary control on inter-annual variation in ET across all catchments and that the timing of recharge is a second-order control. Low AWC, however, increases the sensitivity of annual ET to these climate drivers by 3 to 5 times in our two study basins with drier summers. ET\textendash climate relationships in our Colorado basin receiving summer precipitation are more stable across subsurface drainage and storage characteristics. Climate driver\textendash ET relationships are most sensitive to subsurface storage (AWC) and drainage parameters related to lateral redistribution in the relatively dry Sierra site that receives little summer precipitation. Our results demonstrate that uncertainty in geophysically mediated storage and drainage properties can strongly influence model estimates of watershed-scale ET responses to climate variation and climate change. This sensitivity to uncertainty in geophysical properties is particularly true for sites receiving little summer precipitation. A parallel interpretation of this parameter sensitivity is that spatial variation in storage and drainage properties are likely to lead to substantial within-watershed plot-scale differences in forest water use and drought stress.},

A model experiment was performed to assess the effect of wind on the snow cover patterns. A particular objective was to evaluate the role of blowing snow on the glacier formation. The model was run using the data from 11 weather stations over a complete snow season. First, a cross-validation of the meteorological variables interpolation model (MicroMet submodel) was performed to evaluate the performance of the simulated meteorological forcing. Secondly, two SnowModel simulations were set up: one without and the other with the wind transport submodel (SnowTran-3D). Results from both simulations were compared with in situ snow depth measurements and remotely sensed snow cover data. The inclusion of SnowTran-3D does not change the fact that the model is unable to capture the small-scale snow depth spatial variability (as captured by in situ snow depth sensors). However, remote sensing data (MODIS daily snow product) indicate that at broader scales the wind module produced an improved representation of the snow distribution near the glaciers (2-D correlation coefficient increased from R=0.04 to R=0.27). The model outputs show that a key process is the sublimation of blowing snow, which amounts to 18\% of the total ablation over the whole study area, with a high spatial variability. The effect of snow drift is more visible on the glaciers, where wind-transported snow accumulates preferentially. Net deposition occurred for 43\% of the glacier grid points, whereas it is only 23\% of non-glacier grid points located above the minimum glacier altitude (4475m).},

A decline in mountain snowpack, an advance in the timing of spring melt, and a reduction in snow season are projected for five mountain ranges in the region. For the southernmost range (the White Mountains), spring snow at most elevations will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. We investigate soil and fuel moisture changes for the five mountain ranges and for six lowland regions. The accelerated depletion of mountain snowpack due to warming leads to reduced summer soil moisture across mountain environments. Similarly, warmer and drier summers lead to decreases of up to 25\% in dead fuel moisture across all mountain ranges. Collective declines in spring mountain snowpack, summer soil moisture, and fuel moisture across western mountain ranges will increase fire potential in flammability-limited forested systems where fuels are not limiting. Projected changes in fire potential in predominately fuel-limited systems at lower elevations are more uncertain given the confounding signals between projected changes in soil moisture and fuel moisture.},

  abstract = {Many catchment hydrologic and ecologic processes are impacted by the storage capacity of soil water, which is dictated by the profile thickness and water retention properties of soil. Soil water retention properties are primarily controlled by soil texture, which in turn varies spatially in response to microclimate-induced differences in insolation, wetness and temperature. All of these variables can be strongly differentiated by slope aspect. In this study, we compare quantitative measures of soil water retention capacity for two opposing slopes in a semi-arid catchment in southwest Idaho, USA. Undisturbed soil cores from north and south aspects were subjected to a progressive drainage experiment to estimate the soil water retention curve for each sample location. The relatively large sample size (35) supported statistical analysis of slope scale differences in soil water retention between opposing aspects. Soils on the north aspect retain as much as 25\% more water at any given soil water pressure than samples from the south aspect slope. Soil porosity, soil organic matter and silt content were all greater on the north aspect, and each contributed to greater soil water retention. These results, along with the observation that soils on north aspect slopes tend to be deeper, indicate that north aspect slopes can store more water from the wet winter months into the dry summer in this region, an observation with potential implications on ecological function and landscape evolution.

The data assimilation approach explicitly treats sources of uncertainty from model parameters, meteorological inputs, and observations. The method is comprised of two main components: (1) a coupled land surface model (LSM) and snow depletion curve (SDC) model, which is used to generate an ensemble of predictions of SWE and fractional snow cover area (FSCA) for a given set of prior (uncertain) inputs, and (2) a retrospective reanalysis step, which updates estimation variables to be consistent with the observed fractional snow cover time series. The final posterior SWE estimate is generated from the LSM-SDC using the posterior estimation variables consistently with all postulated sources of uncertainty in the model, inputs, and observations. A reasonable agreement was found between the SWE reanalysis and in situ SWE observations and streamflow data. The data set was studied to evaluate factors controlling SWE spatial and temporal variability. Elevation was found to be the primary control on spatial patterns of peak-SWE and day-of-peak. The easting coordinate had additional explanatory power, which is hypothesized to be related to rain shadow effects due to the prevailing storm track directions. The spatial patterns were found to be interannually inconsistent. However, drier years and lower elevations were found more variable than wetter years and higher elevations, respectively. Only a very small percentage of the Kern River watershed had a significant trend in peak-SWE and day-of-peak. Trends deemed to be significant were found to be positive (peak-SWE is increasing and day-of-peak occurs later) at higher elevations, but negative (peak-SWE is decreasing and day-of-peak occurs earlier) at lower elevations. The reanalysis approach proved to be useful in terms of identifying subwatershed variability and trends, and could be extended to larger regions and areas where in situ data are sparse or unavailable.},

  abstract = {Snow accumulation and melt is highly variable in space and time in complex mountainous environments. Therefore, it is necessary to provide high-resolution spatially and temporally distributed estimates of sub-basin snow water equivalent (SWE) to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. In this study, we compare two reconstruction techniques (a commonly used deterministic reconstruction vs a probabilistic data assimilation framework). The methods retrospectively estimate SWE from a time series of remotely sensed maps of fractional snow-covered area (FSCA). In testing both methods over the Tokopah watershed in the Sierra Nevada (California), the probabilistic reconstruction approach is shown to be a more robust generalization of the deterministic reconstruction. Under idealized conditions, both probabilistic and deterministic approaches perform reasonably well and yield similar results when compared with in situ verification data, whereas the probabilistic reconstruction was found to be in slightly better agreement with snow-pit observations. More importantly, the probabilistic approach was found to be more robust: unaccounted for biases in solar radiation impacted the probabilistic SWE estimates less than the deterministic case (4\% vs 7\% errors for water year (WY)1997 and 0\% vs 3\% errors for WY1999); the probabilistic reconstruction was found to be less sensitive to the number of available observations (6\% vs 10\% errors in WY1997 and 13\% vs 44\% errors in WY1999 from the nominal cases when four fewer FSCA images were available). Finally, results from the probabilistic reconstruction approach, which requires precipitation inputs (unlike the deterministic approach), were found to be relatively robust to bias in prior precipitation estimates, where the nominal case mean estimates were recovered even when an underestimated prior precipitation was used. The additional robustness of the probabilistic SWE reconstruction technique should prove useful in future applications over larger basins and longer periods in mountainous terrain.

Linear extrapolations of historical SWE/streamflow relationships suggest that annual minimum flows in some catchments could decrease to zero if peak SWE is reduced to roughly half of its historical average. For every 10\% decrease in peak SWE, annual minimum flows decrease 9\textendash 22\% and occur 3\textendash 7 days earlier in the year. In two of the study catchments, Sagehen and Pitman Creeks, seasonal low flows are significantly correlated with the previous year's snowpack as well as the current year's snowpack. We explore how future warming could affect the relationship between winter snowpacks and summer low flows, using a distributed hydrologic model Regional Hydro-ecologic Ecosystem Simulation System (RHESSys) to simulate the response of two study catchments. Model results suggest that a 10\% decrease in peak SWE will lead to a 1\textendash 8\% decrease in low flows. The modelled streams do not dry up completely, because the effects of reduced SWE are partly offset by increased fall or winter net gains in storage, and by shifts in the timing of peak evapotranspiration. We consider how groundwater storage, snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates, and precipitation phase (snow vs rain) influence catchment response to warming.

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the seasonal accumulation and ablation of snow across mid-latitude mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere with profound implications for the water resources available to downstream communities and environments. Despite decades of empirical and model-based research on snowmelt-driven streamflow, our ability to predict whether streamflow will increase or decrease in a changing climate remains limited by two factors. First, predictions are fundamentally hampered by high spatial and temporal variability in the processes that control net snow accumulation and ablation across mountainous environments. Second, we lack a consistent and testable framework to coordinate research to determine which dominant mechanisms influencing seasonal snow dynamics are most and least important for streamflow generation in different basins. Our data-driven review marks a step towards the development of such a framework. We first conduct a systematic literature review that synthesizes knowledge about seasonal snowmelt-driven streamflow and how it is altered by climate change, highlighting unsettled questions about how annual streamflow volume is shaped by changing snow dynamics. Drawing from literature, we then propose a framework comprised of three testable, inter-related mechanisms\textemdash snow season mass and energy exchanges, the intensity of snow season liquid water inputs, and the synchrony of energy and water availability. Using data for 537 catchments in the United States, we demonstrate the utility of each mechanism and suggest that streamflow prediction will be more challenging in regions with multiple interacting mechanisms. This framework is intended to inform the research community and improve management predictions as it is tested and refined.},

  abstract = {Elevation strongly affects quantity and distribution patterns of precipitation and snow. Positive elevation gradients were identified by many studies, usually based on data from sparse precipitation stations or snow depth measurements. We present a systematic evaluation of the elevation\textendash snow depth relationship. We analyse areal snow depth data obtained by remote sensing for seven mountain sites near to the time of the maximum seasonal snow accumulation. Snow depths were averaged to 100 m elevation bands and then related to their respective elevation level. The assessment was performed at three scales: (i) the complete data sets (10 km scale), (ii) sub-catchments (km scale) and (iii) slope transects (100 m scale). We show that most elevation\textendash snow depth curves at all scales are characterised through a single shape. Mean snow depths increase with elevation up to a certain level where they have a distinct peak followed by a decrease at the highest elevations. We explain this typical shape with a generally positive elevation gradient of snow fall that is modified by the interaction of snow cover and topography. These processes are preferential deposition of precipitation and redistribution of snow by wind, sloughing and avalanching. Furthermore, we show that the elevation level of the peak of mean snow depth correlates with the dominant elevation level of rocks (if present).},

Using a new type of terrestrial laser scanner, which is particularly suited for measurements of snow covered surfaces, snow depth was monitored in a high alpine catchment during an ablation period. From these measurements snow water equivalents and ablation rates were calculated. This allowed us for the first time to obtain a high resolution (2.5 m cell size) picture of spatial variability of the snow cover and its temporal development. A very high variability of the snow cover with snow depths between 0\textendash 9 m at the end of the accumulation season was observed. This variability decreased during the ablation phase, while the dominant snow deposition features remained intact. The average daily ablation rate was between 15 mm/d snow water equivalent at the beginning of the ablation period and 30 mm/d at the end. The spatial variation of ablation rates increased during the ablation season and could not be explained in a simple manner by geographical or meteorological parameters, which suggests significant lateral energy fluxes contributing to observed melt. It is qualitatively shown that the effect of the lateral energy transport must increase as the fraction of snow free surfaces increases during the ablation period.},

This approach allows inclusion of interaction effects, drawing a more representative picture of the resulting sensitivities. We utilize all combinations of a multiphysics snowpack model to mirror the influence of model structure. Uncertainty ranges of model parameters and input data are extracted from the literature. We evaluate a suite of 230,000 model realizations at the snow monitoring station K\"uhtai (Tyrol, Austria, 1,920 m above sea level) against snow water equivalent observations. The results show throughout the course of 25 winter seasons (1991\textendash 2015) and different model performance criteria a large influence of forcing data uncertainty and its interactions on the model performance. Mean interannual total sensitivity indices are in the general order of parameter choice {$<$} model structure {$<$} forcing error, with precipitation, air temperature, and the radiative forcings controlling the variance during the accumulation period and air temperature and longwave irradiance controlling the variance during the ablation period, respectively. Model skill is highly sensitive to the snowpack liquid water transport scheme throughout the whole winter period and to albedo representation during the ablation period. We found a sufficiently long evaluation period ({$>$}10 years) is required for robust averaging. A considerable interaction effect was revealed, indicating that an improvement in the knowledge (i.e., reduction of uncertainty) of one factor alone might not necessarily improve model results.},

Area burned has a similar, nonlinear sensitivity, with 1\textdegree C of warming yielding a 22 to 25\% increase in risk.

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall and snowmelt (i.e., surface water inputs, SWI) control soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and streamflow at annual, seasonal, and event scales. In the rain-snow transition zone, comprising a large portion of the mountainous western United States, there is limited understanding of the sensitivity of spatiotemporal SWI dynamics across hydrologically variable water years (WYs). We modeled rainfall and snowpack dynamics in a small headwater catchment (1.8~km2) spanning the rain-snow transition in southwestern Idaho, USA, for two hydrologically distinct WYs (2011 and 2014). In wet WY 2011 and dry WY 2014, total precipitation drove spatial variability in annual SWI. Snow drifts generated more SWI (901\textendash 2080~mm) than high-elevation scour zones (442\textendash 640~mm), which generated less SWI than mid-elevation, non-drift locations (452\textendash 784~mm). Seasonally, energy fluxes differed most during the snowmelt period, where higher net radiation at lower elevations and south-facing slopes drove SWI production. At the rain-on-snow (ROS) event scale, higher elevations and north-facing slopes generated 15\textendash 20~\% of annual SWI, due mainly to higher turbulent fluxes. The most productive ROS events occurred after peak snow water equivalent (SWE), when rainfall fell onto ripe snowpacks. Snow drift locations were less susceptible to melt during ROS events, offset by the larger cold content and snowpack mass. Thus, catchment water resources depend on SWI magnitude, location, and timing, which are moderated by drift persistence at all temporal scales. As the climate warms, shifts in spatiotemporal SWI distribution are expected with declines in snowfall and snowfall redistribution in this area.},

Study focus As the climate warms, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is expected to decrease and the timing of snowmelt is expected to shift earlier in spring. In snow-dominated regions, these changes in snow accumulation and melt prompt us to examine downstream changes in streamflow. The objective of this study is to understand how changes in precipitation phase and snowmelt timing alter the timing of surface water inputs (i.e. rainfall and snowmelt) and the partitioning of these inputs between evapotranspiration and streamflow. We used the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model and Weather Research and Forecasting Model-based projections of future climatic conditions to simulate streamflow. New hydrological insights for the region Modeled annual streamflow decreased by 22\% for the period 2071\textendash 2100. Surface water inputs increased during winter when atmospheric water demand was relatively low. Subsequently, the winter-period partitioning of water (as rain or snowmelt) to streamflow (as opposed to evapotranspiration) increased, by 15\%, while partitioning to evapotranspiration decreased, effectively buffering what would have otherwise been a larger net streamflow decline associated with warming. Seasonal streamflow buffering is unique to snow-influenced systems, as the magnitude and timing of water released from snowpacks is sensitive to warming. This effect may diminish as warming drives snow-influenced systems toward rain-dominance, with implications for hydrological and ecological processes and water-resource management.},

Water levels have declined dramatically in the last 100+ years due to diversion of inflows, drought and climate change. Satellite-derived environmental science data records (ESDRs) from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (snow cover, evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface temperature (LST)), enable a unique approach to evaluate the effects of aridification on terminal lakes and to study their individual vulnerabilities. Surface and air temperatures in the GB are rising dramatically, with a sharp rise in the rate of increase observed beginning around 2011, while the number of days of snow cover is declining especially in the western mountainous part of the GB as exemplified in Mono Basin, California. Rising temperatures coincide with fewer days of snow cover, a decrease of inflow to the lakes and greater evaporation of water from the lakes. MODIS ESDRs show strong and statistically significant increasing surface temperature (LST) in the GB, a reduction in the number of days of snow cover, and mixed results in ET. ET declined slightly in the more arid parts of the GB due to greater moisture restrictions to evaporation from extended drought, while ET increased in the more-vegetated, wetter, mountainous northeastern parts as temperatures have risen. Severe and costly ecological, human health and economic consequences are expected if the lakes continue to decline as predicted.},

  abstract = {Using precipitation and temperature data for the 20th century in combination with a macroscale hydrologic model, we evaluate changes in flood risk in the western U.S. associated both with century-scale warming and interannual climate variations. In addition, we examine the implications of apparent increases in precipitation variability over the region since the mid-1970s. We use detrended temperature data representing early and late 20th century climate to force the variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model and show that spatially homogeneous temperature changes over the western U.S. in the 20th century on the order of +1\textdegree C per century have resulted in substantial changes in flood risks over much of the region. Although changes specific to particular geographic areas are apparent in some cases, the overall changes due to observed warming trends are well categorized by midwinter temperature regimes in each watershed. Cold river basins where snow processes dominate the annual hydrologic cycle ({$<-$}6\textdegree C average in midwinter) typically show reductions in flood risk due to overall reductions in spring snowpack. Relatively warm rain-dominant basins ({$>$}5\textdegree C average in midwinter) show little systematic change. Intermediate or transient basins show a wide range of effects depending on competing factors such as the relative role of antecedent snow and contributing basin area during storms that cause flooding. Warmer transient basins along the coast in Washington, Oregon, and California, in particular, tend to show increased flood risk. While the absolute value of simulated changes in flood risk is affected by basin scale, the nature of the relationship of flood risk to basin temperatures in midwinter is largely scale-independent. Climate variations associated with Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also have strong effects on flood risks. In contrast to the effects associated with 20th century warming, the climate variability signal is characterized by regional scale patterns related to the geographic distribution of cool season precipitation also identified in many previous studies. In general, the largest changes in simulated flood risks are associated with years when PDO and ENSO are ``in phase,'' particularly in the southwest. Changes in the variability of cool season precipitation after about 1973, the causes of which are uncertain, are shown to result in increased flood risk over much of the western U.S. in the simulations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown substantial declines in snow water equivalent (SWE) over much of the western United States in the last half century, as well as trends toward earlier spring snowmelt and peak spring streamflows. These trends are influenced both by interannual and decadal-scale climate variability, and also by temperature trends at longer time scales that are generally consistent with observations of global warming over the twentieth century. In this study, the linear trends in 1 April SWE over the western United States are examined, as simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model implemented at 1/8\textdegree{} latitude\textendash longitude spatial resolution, and driven by a carefully quality controlled gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset for the period 1915\textendash 2003. The long simulations of snowpack are used as surrogates for observations and are the basis for an analysis of regional trends in snowpack over the western United States and southern British Columbia, Canada. By isolating the trends due to temperature and precipitation in separate simulations, the influence of temperature and precipitation variability on the overall trends in SWE is evaluated. Downward trends in 1 April SWE over the western United States from 1916 to 2003 and 1947 to 2003, and for a time series constructed using two warm Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) epochs concatenated together, are shown to be primarily due to widespread warming. These temperature-related trends are not well explained by decadal climate variability associated with the PDO. Trends in SWE associated with precipitation trends, however, are very different in different time periods and are apparently largely controlled by decadal variability rather than longer-term trends in climate.},

These include, for instance, soil moisture, snow water equivalent, evapotranspiration, runoff, and subsurface moisture transport. However, gridding procedures can themselves introduce artificial trends due to incorporation of stations with different record lengths and locations. Hence, existing gridded datasets are in general not appropriate for estimation of long-term trends. Methods are described here for adjustment of gridded daily precipitation and temperature maxima and minima over the continental United States based on newly available (in electronic form) U.S. Cooperative Observer station data archived at the National Climatic Data Center from the early 1900s on. The intent is to produce gridded meteorological datasets that can be used, in conjunction with hydrologic modeling, for long-term trend analysis of simulated hydrologic variables.},

  abstract = {A physically based hydrology model is used to produce time series for the period 1916\textendash 2003 of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, and soil moisture (SM) over the western United States from which long-term trends are evaluated. The results show that trends in ET in spring and summer are determined primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt that determine water availability. From April to June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in spring precipitation. From July to September trends in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation trends, with the exception of areas (most notably California) that receive little summer precipitation and have experienced large changes in snowmelt timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are modest, but during the period 1947\textendash 2003 when temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift of ET from midsummer to early summer and late spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is related primarily to increasing temperature, and is most apparent during 1947\textendash 2003. Trends in the annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western water management, are determined primarily by trends in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the signature of temperature-related trends in runoff and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [December\textendash February (DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer winter temperatures show increasing trends in the runoff fraction as early as February, and colder areas as late as June. Trends toward earlier spring SM recharge are apparent and increasing trends in SM on 1 April are evident over much of the region. The 1 July SM trends are less affected by snowmelt changes and are controlled more by precipitation trends.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow is a critical component of the surface energy balance and hydrologic cycle, yet global maps of seasonal snow boundaries are not readily available. Snow persistence (SP), the fraction of a year that snow is present on the ground, is an easily globally observed snow metric that can be used to map snow zones globally. Here we map snow zones across the globe using SP calculated from the MODIS10A2 product; evaluate how SP relates to precipitation, temperature, and climate indices; and examine trends in annual SP for 2001\textendash 2016. In the Northern Hemisphere, intermittent, seasonal, and permanent snow zones occupy a far greater percent (63\%) of the land surface than in the Southern Hemisphere ({$<$}5\%) where the low snow zone dominates ({$>$}95\%). SP is most variable from year to year near the snow line, which has a relatively consistent decrease in elevation with increasing latitude across all continents. At lower elevations, SP is typically best correlated with temperature, whereas precipitation has greater relative importance for SP at high elevations. SP is best correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation in all continents except South America, where the Southern Annular Mode is a stronger influence, and Africa, where the strongest correlation is with the Oceanic Ni\~no Index. Areas with decreasing SP trends cover 5.8\% of snow zone areas, whereas those with increasing trends cover 1.0\% of this area. The largest areas of declining SP are in the seasonal snow zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Trend patterns vary within individual regions, with elevation, and on windward-leeward sides of the mountains. This study supplies a framework for comparing snow between regions, highlights areas with snow changes, and can facilitate analyses of why snow changes vary within and between regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the winter of 1993/94 a study to quantify the winter energy balance of the main cover types of the boreal landscape took place. The study was based on the southern edge of boreal forest in Canada. Measurements were made over a mature jack pine stand and a frozen lake. Shortwave albedos of 12\% to 14\% over the jack pine and 20\% to 88\% on the frozen lake (both depending on snow cover) were measured. There were correspondingly large contrasts in the total radiation inputs and the turbulent heat fluxes. The mean net all-wave radiation input was large and positive into the forest and negative over the lake. The sensible heat fluxes were of the same sign as the radiative inputs with positive values over the forest peaking at +200 W m-2 and failing to - 100 W m-2 over the lake. The evaporation from the forest depended on whether the there was snow on the canopy. When the canopy was snow-free, the evaporation was low, about 50\% of net radiation but, when there was snow on the canopy, the evaporation was large, 4 mm over a 36-hour period. The results of these experiments are being used to design much-improved descriptions of boreal forest within the next generation of climate, models.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have documented declining snow water equivalent (SWE) and earlier melt in the coastal Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and climate models suggest that warming temperatures will decrease snowpack storage in the higher-elevation mountain ranges of interior western North America. To date, however, observations of changing SWE or snowmelt have been limited to the state of Colorado in the intermountain west (IMW), defined here as the Rio Grande, Colorado River, and Great Basins, which supply water to the driest regions of North America. We used daily SNOTEL data collected between 1984 and 2009 combined with the nonparametric regional Kendall test to demonstrate significant and widespread changes in the duration of snow cover in these river basins. Daily SNOTEL data demonstrated that basin average maximum SWE occurred as early as 7 March (Lower Colorado River Basin) and as late as 13 April (Upper Colorado, Yampa, and White River Basins). Although significant increases in winter temperature (T) were widespread, there were minimal changes in the day of maximum accumulation and no indications from SWE to winter precipitation ratios (SWE:P) and winter T observations that a transition from snow to rain had occurred. While there was little change in day of maximum accumulation, the duration of snow cover decreased in 11 of 13 drainage regions, and snowmelt center of mass (SM50) advanced 1 to 4 days per decade in 6 of 13 regions. There were significant trends toward a faster SM50 and shorter duration of snow cover in the highest-elevation regions ({$>$}2800 m) of the Colorado River Basin, suggesting that winter T and P may not be the primary driver of change. Our results show that the IMW hydroclimate is both spatially and temporally variable, with few changes in winter T and P in the Great Basin and drier and warmer winters in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The changes in snowmelt timing also were variable, with a shorter SM50 and less maximum SWE in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The variable response of snowpacks in the IMW to widespread warming highlights the need for additional research into the mass and energy balance of these continental snowpacks.},

  abstract = {Altered snowpack regimes from regional warming threaten mountain ecosystems with greater water stress and increased likelihood of vegetation disturbance. The sensitivity of vegetation to changing snowpack conditions is strongly mediated by soil water storage, yet a framework to identify areas sensitive to changing snowpack regimes is lacking. In this study we ask two questions: (1) How will changing snowmelt alter the duration of soil water stress and length of the soil-mediated growing season (shortened to water stress and growing season, respectively)? and (2) What site characteristics increase the sensitivity of water stress and growing season duration to changes in snowmelt? We compiled soil moisture at 5, 20 and 50cm depths from 62 SNOTEL sites with {$>$}5 years of records and detailed soil properties. Soil water stress was estimated based on measured wilting point water content. The day of snow disappearance consistently explained the greatest variability in water stress across all site-years and within individual sites, while summer precipitation explained the most variability in growing season length. On average, a one day earlier snow disappearance resulted in 0.62 days greater water stress and 36 of 62 sites had significant relationships between snow disappearance and water stress. Despite earlier snow disappearance leading to greater water stress at nearly all sites, earlier snow disappearance led to both significant increases (4 of 62) and decreases (5 of 62) in growing season length. Satellite derived vegetation greenness confirmed site-dependent changes could both increase and reduce maximum annual vegetation greenness with earlier snow disappearance. A simple soil moisture model demonstrated the potential for diverging growing season length with earlier snow disappearance was more likely in areas with finer soil texture, greater rooting depth, greater potential evapotranspiration, and greater precipitation. More work is needed to understand the role of decreasing snowpacks, summer precipitation, and deeper soil processes in modulating sensitivity to earlier snowmelt. The potential for heterogeneity in mountain environments to cause diverging growing season length from earlier snowmelt over relatively small spatial scales has important implications for water budgets and development of refugia to regional warming.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering historical patterns of snow accumulation and melt, threatening societal frameworks for water supply. However, decreases in spring snow water equivalent (SWE) and changes in snowmelt are not ubiquitous despite widespread warming in the western United States, highlighting the importance of latent and radiant energy fluxes in snow ablation. Here we demonstrate how atmospheric humidity and solar radiation interact with warming temperature to control snowpack ablation at 462 sites spanning a gradient in mean winter temperature from -8.9 to +2.9 \textdegree C. The most widespread response to warming was an increase in episodic, midwinter ablation events. Under humid conditions these ablation events were dominated by melt, averaging 21\% (202 mm/year) of SWE. Winter ablation under dry atmospheric conditions at similar temperatures was smaller, averaging 12\% (58 mm/year) of SWE and likely dominated by sublimation fluxes. These contrasting patterns result from the critical role that atmospheric humidity plays in local energy balance, with latent and longwave radiant fluxes cooling the snowpack under dry conditions and warming it under humid conditions. Similarly, spring melt rates were faster under humid conditions, yet the second most common trend was a reduction in spring melt rates associated with earlier initiation when solar radiation inputs are smaller. Our analyses demonstrate that regional differences in atmospheric humidity are a major cause of the spatial variability in snowpack response to warming. Better constraints on humidity will be critical to predicting both the amount and timing of surface water supplies under climate change.},

  abstract = {Forest manipulation using forest thinning is one of the few means to manage water resources supplying downstream populations that are derived from snow-covered montane forests. The challenges of simulating processes at the tree scale have precluded generalizable recommendations for removing tree canopy to maximize snow water resources. Here, we apply the high-resolution Snow Physics and Lidar Mapping (SnowPALM) model to simulate snow mass and energy budgets at 1-m scale over a 1,200 by 1,200 m domain on the west shore of Lake Tahoe, Sierra Nevada, USA. The SnowPALM model verifies well against observations of snow depth and snow temperature in open and under canopy locations. This supported the application of SnowPALM under ``virtual thinning'' experiments, where all trees {$<$}5, {$<$}10, {$<$}15, and {$<$}20 m height were removed during a 3-year simulation. Increasing snowpack sublimation losses are smaller than reductions in canopy interception resulting in an overall increase in melt volume. Despite relatively modest melt volume increases of 4\textendash 8\% across the entire domain, individual 30-m stands could have {$>$}30\% melt volume increases. On average, a 0.5 decrease in lidar-derived leaf area resulted in an 10.5\% increase in melt volume, with shorter, denser 30-m forest stands having greater melt volume sensitivity. These dense forest stands, where forest thinning was most effective, were found in valley bottoms and north-facing slopes across the west shore region. This proof of concept supports large domain simulations using high-resolution models to inform landscape-scale restoration decisions.},

  abstract = {The intensity of mountain precipitation is often modified by snow accumulation and melt, yet rainfall-based observations are widely used in planning and design. Comparisons of extreme rainfall versus snowmelt intensities are needed because they have different predictability and hazard implications. Regional warming is expected to intensify not only rainfall and snowfall but also slow snowmelt, which could further challenge intensity duration frequency (IDF) techniques. We use observations from 379 mountain sites across the western U.S. to estimate the 10 and 100 year intensity at 1, 2, and 30 day durations for historical snowmelt (SM), precipitation occurring during snow cover (SCP), and precipitation during the snow-free period (SFP). At 1 day durations, 100 year SCP was greater than SM and SFP at 40\% of sites, while SM was larger than SCP and SFP at 39\% of sites. At 30 day durations, SM was greater than SCP and SFP at 95\% of sites. The continental sites are generally insensitive to increased water input intensity from SCP occurring as rainfall. In contrast, the maritime mountains are relatively insensitive to changes in SM but have the potential for increased water input intensity from greater SCP occurring as rainfall. Standard precipitation intensity data sets accurately estimated the 100 year, 1 day SCP and SM but underestimated SM at 78 continental sites where SM was greater than SCP and SFP. These results confirm that snow processes modify IDF estimates and highlight regional sensitivity to increased winter rainfall and slower snowmelt that may necessitate local adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Snow droughts are commonly defined as below-average snowpack at a point in time, typically 1 April in the western United States (wUS). This definition is valuable for interpreting the state of the snowpack but obscures the temporal evolution of snow drought. Borrowing from dynamical systems theory, we applied phase diagrams to visually examine the daily evolution of snow water equivalent (SWE) and accumulated precipitation conditions in maritime, intermountain, and continental snow climates in the wUS using station observations as well as spatially distributed estimates of SWE and precipitation. Using a percentile-based drought definition, phase diagrams of SWE and precipitation highlighted decision-relevant aspects of snow drought such as onset, evolution, and termination. The phase diagram approach can be used in tandem with spatially distributed estimates of daily SWE and precipitation to reveal variability in snow drought type and extent. When combined with streamflow or other environmental data, phase diagrams and spatial estimates of snow drought conditions can help inform drought monitoring and early warning systems and help link snow drought type and evolution to impacts on ecosystems, water resources, and recreation. A web tool is introduced allowing users to create real-time or historic snow drought phase diagrams.},

  abstract = {The magnitude of future climate change depends substantially on the greenhouse gas emission pathways we choose. Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50\textendash 75\%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30\textendash 70\%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75\textendash 90\%; and snowpack declines 73\textendash 90\%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades.},

  abstract = {In the Colorado Front Range, forested catchments near the rain\textendash snow transition are likely to experience changes in snowmelt delivery and subsurface water transport with climate warming and associated shifts in precipitation patterns. Snowpack dynamics are strongly affected by aspect: Lodgepole pine forested north-facing slopes develop a seasonal snowpack, whereas Ponderosa pine-dotted south-facing slopes experience intermittent snow accumulation throughout winter and spring. We tested the degree to which these contrasting water input patterns cause different near-surface hydrologic response on north-facing and south-facing hillslopes during the snowmelt period. During spring snowmelt, we applied lithium bromide (LiBr) tracer to instrumented plots along a north\textendash south catchment transect. Bromide broke through immediately at 10- and 30-cm depths on the north-facing slope and was transported out of soil waters within 40 days. On the south-facing slope, Br- was transported to significant depths only during spring storms and remained above the detection limit throughout the study. Modelling of unsaturated zone hydrologic response using Hydrus-1D corroborated these aspect-driven differences in subsurface transport. Our multiple lines of evidence suggest that north-facing slopes are dominated by connected flow through the soil matrix, whereas south-facing slope soils experience brief periods of rapid vertical transport following snowmelt events and are drier overall than north-facing slopes. These differences in hydrologic response were largely a function of energy-driven differences in water supply, emphasizing the importance of aspect and climate forcing when considering contributions of water and solutes to streamflow in catchments near the snow line.

We merge complementary information from different data streams with a regression-based approach to estimate the 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) volume over Sierra Nevada, USA.

With the resulting data-driven merged time series (1940\textendash 2018), we conduct frequency analysis to estimate return periods and associated uncertainty, which can inform decisions about the water supply, drought response, and flood control. We show that the shorter (\textasciitilde 30-year) reanalysis results in an underestimation of the 100-year return period by \textasciitilde 25 years (relative to the \textasciitilde 80-year merged dataset). Drought and flood risk and water resources planning can be substantially affected if return periods of SWE, which are closely related to potential flooding in spring and water availability in summer, are misrepresented.},

  abstract = {A detailed picture of how snowfall varies across high-elevation mountain ranges in both space and time remains a knowledge gap in understanding the montane hydrologic cycle. Previous studies generally used point-scale snow measurements in an attempt to represent the spatial variability of snowfall across a range; however, these traditional approaches provide incomplete insight into the cumulative snowfall (CS) distribution from the basin-scale to the mountain range-scale. In this study, a high-resolution, spatially distributed snow reanalysis was utilized to characterize 31 winters (water years 1985\textendash 2015) of snowfall distributions, snowfall accumulation rates, and snowstorms across the Sierra Nevada (USA). The CS data set (quantified in units of snow water equivalent) was verified against over 2600 station years of in situ observations. The seasonal CS was found to have mean and root-mean-squared differences of 24 and 12 cm, respectively, and a correlation of 0.96 with snow pillow observations. Using this novel CS information, results indicated that the CS accumulates rapidly across all 20 basins examined with, on average, at least 50\% of the integrated CS accumulating in less than or equal to 6 days or three snowstorms over each basin. The largest (or leading) snowstorms each season yield  27\% of the CS, on average, and most frequently last 4 days. Across the range, over 40\% of the leading snowstorms occur in February. This study showed that the hydroclimatology of the Sierra Nevada is driven by hydrological extremes as manifested in the high interannual variability of its seasonally integrated CS, 4.4\textendash 41.3 km3, during the 31 years.},

Changes in the duration and intensity of droughts can significantly impact ecosystems, food and water security, agriculture, hydropower, and the socioeconomics of a region. We characterize the duration and intensity of snow droughts (snow water equivalent deficits) worldwide and differences in their distributions over 1980 to 2018. We find that snow droughts became more prevalent, intensified, and lengthened across the western United States (WUS). Eastern Russia, Europe, and the WUS emerged as hot spots for snow droughts, experiencing {$\sim$}2, 16, and 28\% longer snow drought durations, respectively, in the latter half of 1980 to 2018. In this second half of the record, these regions exhibited a higher probability (relative to the first half of the record) of having a snow drought exceed the average intensity from the first period by 3, 4, and 15\%. The Hindu Kush and Central Asia, extratropical Andes, greater Himalayas, and Patagonia, however, experienced decreases (percent changes) in the average snow drought duration (-4, -7, -8, and -16\%, respectively). Although we do not attempt to separate natural and human influences with a detailed attribution analysis, we discuss some relevant physical processes (e.g., Arctic amplification and polar vortex movement) that likely contribute to observed changes in snow drought characteristics. We also demonstrate how our framework can facilitate drought monitoring and assessment by examining two snow deficits that posed large socioeconomic challenges in the WUS (2014/2015) and Afghanistan (2017/2018).},

A novel, 90-m spatially distributed snow water equivalent (SWE) reanalysis was used to overcome these limitations. Leveraging this SWE information, the interannual variability of orographic gradients in cumulative snowfall (CS) was investigated over 14 windward (western) basins in the Sierra Nevada in California from water years 1985 to 2015. Previous studies have not provided a detailed multidecadal climatology of orographic CS gradients or compared wet-year and dry-year orographic CS patterns, distributions, and gradients across an entire mountain range. The magnitude of seasonal CS gradients range from over 15 cm SWE per 100-m elevation to under 1 cm per 100 m with a 31-yr average of 6.1 cm per 100 m below ;2500 m in the western basins. The 31-yr average CS gradients generally decrease in higher elevation zones across the western basins and become negative at the highest elevations. On average, integrated vapor transport and zonal winds at 700 hPa are larger during wet years, leading to higher orographically driven CS gradients across the Sierra Nevada than in dry years. Below ;2500 m, wet years yield greater enhancement (relative to dry years) by factors of approximately 2 and 3 in the northwestern and southwestern basins, respectively. Overall, the western Sierra Nevada experiences about twice as much orographic enhancement during wet years as in dry years below the elevation corresponding to the 31-yr average maximum CS.},

Warmer temperatures decrease the amount of montane snow water equivalent (SWE), forcing its center of mass to higher elevations. We use a unique multivariate probabilistic framework to quantify the response of the 1 April SWE volume and its centroid to a 1.0 to 2.0 \textdegree C increase in winter air temperature across the Sierra Nevada (United States). A 1.0 \textdegree C increase reduces the probability of exceeding the long-term (1985\textendash 2016) average rangewide SWE volume (15.7 km               3               ) by 20.7\%. It correspondingly is 60.6\% more likely for the centroid to be higher than its long-term average (2,540 m). We further show that a 1.5 and 2.0 \textdegree C increase in the winter temperature reduces the probability of exceeding the long-term average SWE volume by 31.0\% and 41.1\%, respectively, whereas it becomes 79.3\% and 89.8\% more likely that the centroid will be higher than 2,540 m for those respective temperature changes. We also characterize regional variability across the Sierra Nevada and show that the northwestern and southeastern regions of the mountain range are 30.3\% and 14.0\% less likely to have 1 April SWE volumes exceed their long-term average for a 1.0 \textdegree C increase about their respective average winter temperatures. Overall, the SWE in the northern Sierra Nevada exhibits higher hydrologic vulnerability to warming than in the southern region. Given the expected increases in mountain temperatures, the observed rates of change in SWE are expected to intensify in the future.},

Spatial resolution differences have relatively minor effects on the number of ARs diagnosed, with higher-resolution data sets identifying four more AR days per year, on average, during the 1985\textendash 2015 winters. However, this can lead to 10\% difference in AR attribution to the mean domain-wide seasonal CS and differences up to 47\% snowfall attribution at the seasonal scale.

Previous studies do not distinguish between days with and without precipitation, which effectively dilutes temperature trends relevant for snowpack monitoring. We examined trends in cold-season precipitation and impacts on snow in nine mountain regions across the western United States. Using 33 years of daily meteorological data (1984\textendash 2016) from 567 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites and a homogenized daily temperature dataset (TopoWx), we investigated seasonal and regional trends in storm day temperatures, storm day frequency, and resulting snowpack fate. We found widespread warming of 0.4 \textdegree C\textendash 1.2 \textdegree C per decade, especially during the fall and in the Interior West using tests for statistically significant trends. Disaggregation showed that days with precipitation are warming nearly twice as fast as dry days in the fall and winter. We also observed increases in November dry days, increased melt on dry days throughout the accumulation season, spring cooling and declines in daily snowmelt during snow-depleting storm days. These findings demonstrate the importance of disaggregating temperature data to elucidate trends (in storm day frequency, accumulation and melt, and warming and cooling) and their impacts on snow in the western US.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread warming in mountain regions, little research to date has explored the physical mechanisms driving the variable response of snowpacks to changes in climate, instead focusing primarily on empirical relationships, such as seasonal air temperature or elevation. In this work, we evaluate how differences in snowfall fraction, cold content, and the snowpack energy balance produce simulated changes to snow accumulation and melt at an alpine and subalpine snowpack in the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site. For our analysis, we created a 23 years baseline simulation using the SNOWPACK model forced by historical hourly meteorological data from water year 1991 through 2013. We then perturbed hourly air temperature in 0.5\textdegree C increments from +0.5 to +4.0\textdegree C above baseline and increased incoming longwave radiation accordingly. For every 1\textdegree C of warming, peak snow water equivalent declined by 43.9 mm in the alpine and 54.3 mm in the subalpine, melt onset shifted 6.2 days earlier in the alpine and 8.8 days in the subalpine, the snow season shortened by 10.7 days in the alpine and 16.4 days in the subalpine, and melt rate increased by 0.2 mm d-1 in the alpine while decreasing by 0.4 mm d-1 in the subalpine. We found the alpine snowpack was less sensitive to warming for three primary reasons: (1) Snowfall fraction decreased less rapidly per 1\textdegree C of warming than in the subalpine; (2) Cold content still consistently developed throughout the snow season, preventing mid-winter melt events; (3) Changes to snowmelt rate were not significant because increases to the turbulent fluxes balanced decreases in the radiative fluxes with earlier snowmelt onset. Additionally, at 3\textdegree C of warming and greater, the subalpine site experienced a fundamental shift where significant melt could occur throughout the entirety of the winter as cold content was no longer large enough to buffer against positive energy fluxes. In some years, the subalpine snowpack became transient with several cycles of accumulation and melt per winter. This tipping point suggests sites with lower cold content\textemdash like the subalpine studied here\textemdash are likely to be more sensitive to producing increased winter melt as warming continues over the coming decades.},

  abstract = {The distribution of snow and the energy flux components of snowmelt are intrinsic characteristics of the alpine water cycle controlling the location of source waters and the effect of climate on streamflow. Interannual variability of these characteristics is relevant to the effect of climate change on alpine hydrology. Our objective is to characterize the interannual variability in the spatial distribution of snow and energy fluxes of snowmelt in watersheds of a maritime setting, Tokopah Basin (TOK) in California's southern Sierra Nevada, and a continental setting, Green Lake 4 Valley (GLV4) in Colorado's Front Range, using a 12 year database (1996\textendash 2007) of hydrometeorological observations and satellite-derived snow cover. Snowpacks observed in GLV4 exhibit substantially greater spatial variability than in TOK (0.75 versus 0.28 spatial coefficient of variation). In addition, modeling results indicate that the net turbulent energy flux contribution to snowmelt in GLV4 is, on average, 3 times greater in magnitude (mean 29\% versus 10\%) and interannual variability (standard deviation 17\% versus 6\%) than in TOK. These energy flux values exhibit strong seasonality, increasing as the melt season progresses to times later in the year (R2 = 0.54\textendash 0.77). This seasonality of energy flux appears to be associated with snowmelt rates that generally increase with onset date of melt (0.02 cm d-2). This seasonality in snowmelt rate, coupled to differences in hydrogeology, may account for the observed differences in correspondence between the timing of snowmelt and timing of streamflow in these watersheds.},

  author = {Julander, Randall P and Bricco, Michael},
  abstract = {Snowpack data collection has a long and storied history in Utah as well as the western United States. Many researchers use historical snow course data for various applications ranging from water supply forecasting to climate change. These data are far from a perfect data set and data users should know the errors and limitations within them. In the current setting, only those collecting the data have access to the raw data and the site biographical information. In Utah, records extend back to at least 1912. Systematic measurements began in the mid 1920's with many long term snow courses established at that time. In an extremely fortuitous circumstance, Mr. George D. Clyde (former Governor of Utah) was responsible for the Snow Survey Program during the 1930's in Utah and had foresight to document each existing Snow Course in the year 1936. Each site was meticulously mapped, described and most important, photographed from several angles. Comparisons are made between the 1936 photographs, maps and descriptions and current conditions, specifically with regard to vegetation and sample point location. General conclusions are made regarding the impact that vegetation change has had on snow accumulation at each course. Changes in sampling technique and data processing are documented, particularly with regard to sample density and the re-sampling (or lack thereof in the record up to the 1950's) of individual sample points when density thresholds are exceeded. With the advent of weather modification programs, changes in snow accumulation could reasonably be expected. Utah began a relatively small test weather modification program in the 1950's in central Utah. The Utah cloud seeding act was passed in 1973 and the seeding program has continued since that time. Snow Courses affected by this program are identified and the potential impact on historical data. Finally, recommendations for individual snow course suitability for long term study based on consistency are made for each of the courses examined. SNOTEL sites, the automated version of the snow courses began to be installed in the late 1970's and early 1980's. These sites to a lesser degree due to the shorter historical time of data collection, have been impacted by vegetation change as well. They also have data impacted by sensor changes and weather modification. Because snow course data are often used to extrapolate the SNOTEL data set to a longer time frame, it is important that external influences in this data set are quantified as well.},

We used site water balance (actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit) and topography (slope position, slope, and insolation) as environmental predictors. Random forest modeling showed that environmental conditions predicted substantial portions of the variations in fire and forest structure: e.g., 85\textendash 93\% of the variation in whether a location did not burn, burned once, or burned twice; 64\% of the variation in the burn severity; and 72\% of the variation in canopy cover {$>$}2m for unburned forests, 64\% for once-burned forests, and 59\% for twice-burned forests. Environmental conditions also predicted a substantial portion of forest structure following one and two fires, even though the post-fire forest structures were substantially different than pre-fire structures. This suggests a feedback mechanism in which local fire regimes and pre-fire forest structures are related to local environments, and their interaction produces post-fire structures also related to local environments. Among environmental predictors, water balance had the greatest explanatory power, followed by slope position, and then by slope and insolation. Managers could use our methods to help select reference areas that match environmental conditions, identify areas at risk for fires that endanger critical habitat or other resources, and identify climate analog areas to help anticipate and plan for climate change.},

  abstract = {Monthly snow water equivalent (SWE) station observations and gridded temperature data are used to identify mechanisms by which warming affects the temporal and geographical structure of changes in western North American mountain snowpack. We first exploit interannual variability to demonstrate the sensitivity of snowpack to temperature during the various phases of the snow season. We show that mechanisms whereby temperature affects snowpack emerge in the mid to late portion of the snow season (March through May), but are nearly absent during the earliest phase (February), when temperatures are generally well below freezing. The mid to late snow season is precisely when significant loss of snowpack is seen at nearly all locations over the past few decades, both through decreases in snow accumulation and increases in snowmelt. At locations where April 1st SWE has been increasing over the past few decades, the increase is entirely due to a significant enhancement of accumulation during the earliest phase of the snow season, when the sensitivity analysis indicates that temperature is not expected to affect snowpack. Later in the snow season, these stations exhibit significant snowpack loss comparable to the other stations. Based on this analysis, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that recent snowpack changes in western North America are caused by regional-scale warming. Given predictions of future warming, a further reduction in late season snowpack and advancement in the onset of snowmelt should be expected in the coming decades throughout the region.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Snow is a critical contributor to Ontario's water-energy budget, with impacts on water resource management and flood forecasting. Snow water equivalent~(SWE) describes the amount of water stored in a snowpack and is important in deriving estimates of snowmelt. However, only a limited number of sparsely distributed snow survey sites (n=383) exist throughout Ontario. The SNOw Data Assimilation System~(SNODAS) is a daily, 1\,km gridded SWE product that provides uniform spatial coverage across this region; however, we show here that SWE estimates from SNODAS display a strong positive mean bias of 50\,\% (16\,mm SWE) when compared to in situ observations from~2011 to~2018. This study evaluates multiple statistical techniques of varying complexity, including simple subtraction, linear regression and machine learning methods to bias-correct SNODAS SWE estimates using absolute mean bias and RMSE as evaluation criteria. Results show that the random forest~(RF) algorithm is most effective at reducing bias in SNODAS SWE, with an absolute mean bias of 0.2\,mm and RMSE of 3.64\,mm when compared with in situ observations. Other methods, such as mean bias subtraction and linear regression, are somewhat effective at bias reduction; however, only the RF~method captures the nonlinearity in the bias and its interannual variability. Applying the RF model to the full spatio-temporal domain shows that the SWE bias is largest before~2015, during the spring melt period, north of 44.5{$\circ$}\,N and east (downwind) of the Great Lakes. As an independent validation, we also compare estimated snowmelt volumes with observed hydrographs and demonstrate that uncorrected SNODAS SWE is associated with unrealistically large volumes at the time of the spring freshet, while bias-corrected SWE values are highly consistent with observed discharge volumes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We present results from snow-on and snow-off airborne-scanning LiDAR measurements over a 53 km2 area in the southern Sierra Nevada. We found that snow depth as a function of elevation increased approximately 15 cm per 100 m, until reaching an elevation of 3300 m, where depth sharply decreased at a rate of 48 cm per 100 m. Departures from the 15 cm per 100 m trend, based on 1 m elevation-band means of regression residuals, showed slightly less steep increases below 2050 m; steeper increases between 2050 and 3300 m; and less steep increases above 3300 m. Although the study area is partly forested, only measurements in open areas were used. Below approximately 2050 m elevation, ablation and rainfall are the primary causes of departure from the orographic trend. From 2050 to 3300 m, greater snow depths than predicted were found on the steeper terrain of the northwest and the less steep northeast-facing slopes, suggesting that ablation, aspect, slope and wind redistribution all play a role in local snow-depth variability. At elevations above 3300 m, orographic processes mask the effect of wind deposition when averaging over large areas. Also, terrain in this basin becomes less steep above 3300 m. This suggests a reduction in precipitation from upslope lifting and/or the exhaustion of precipitable water from ascending air masses. Our results suggest a cumulative precipitation lapse rate for the 2100\textendash 3300 m range of about 6 cm per 100 m elevation for the accumulation period of 3 December 2009 to 23 March 2010. This is a higher gradient than the widely used PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) precipitation products, but similar to that from reconstruction of snowmelt amounts from satellite snow-cover data. Our findings provide a unique characterization of the consistent, steep average increase in precipitation with elevation in snow-dominated terrain, using high-resolution, highly accurate data and highlighs the importance of solar radiation, wind redistribution and mid-winter melt with regard to snow distribution.},

  abstract = {California's primary hydrologic system, the San Francisco Estuary and its upstream watershed, is vulnerable to the regional hydrologic consequences of projected global climate change. Previous work has shown that a projected warming would result in a reduction of snowpack storage leading to higher winter and lower spring-summer streamflows and increased spring-summer salinities in the estuary. The present work shows that these hydrologic changes exhibit a strong dependence on elevation, with the greatest loss of snowpack volume in the 1300\textendash 2700 m elevation range. Exploiting hydrologic and estuarine modeling capabilities to trace water as it moves through the system reveals that the shift of water in mid-elevations of the Sacramento river basin from snowmelt to rainfall runoff is the dominant cause of projected changes in estuarine inflows and salinity. Additionally, although spring-summer losses of estuarine inflows are balanced by winter gains, the losses have a stronger influence on salinity since longer spring-summer residence times allow the inflow changes to accumulate in the estuary. The changes in inflows sourced in the Sacramento River basin in approximately the 1300\textendash 2200 m elevation range thereby lead to a net increase in estuarine salinity under the projected warming. Such changes would impact ecosystems throughout the watershed and threaten to contaminate much of California's freshwater supply.},

  abstract = {Water management in snowy mountainous regions hinges on forecasting snowmelt runoff. However, droughts are altering snowpack-runoff relationships with ongoing debate about the driving mechanisms. For example, in 2021 in California, less than half of predicted streamflow arrived. Mechanisms proposed for this ``missing'' streamflow included changes in evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall, and subsurface moisture conditions. Here, we demonstrate that ET in drought years generates dry subsurface conditions that reduce runoff in subsequent years. A model including this legacy of depleted moisture storage reduced median error in 2021 forecasts from 60\% to 20\% at 15 minimally disturbed basins and from 18\% to 2\% at 6 water supply basins in the Sierra Nevada (basins range in area from 5 to 23,051 km2 and mean annual precipitation from 814 to 1,549 mm). Our findings indicate that the relationship between snowpack and runoff will evolve as plant ecosystems respond to climate change and alter subsurface water storage dynamics.},

Currently, such characterization still relies on modeling due to measurement scarcity. Here, eight global snow products were examined over HMA using a newly developed High Mountain Asia Snow Reanalysis (HMASR) data set as a reference. The focus of intercomparison was on peak annual snow storage, the first-order determinant of warm-season water availability in snow-dominated basins. Across eight products the climatological peak storage over HMA was found to be 161 {$\pm$} 102 km3 with an average 33\% underestimation relative to HMASR. The inter-product variability in cumulative snowfall (335 {$\pm$} 148 km3) explains the majority ({$>$}80\%) of peak snow storage uncertainty, while significant accumulation-season snowfall loss to ablation (51\% {$\pm$} 9\%) also reveals the critical role of ablation processes on peak snow storage.},

There is high uncertainty about how the frequency of ROS events (ROS) and associated floods will change as climate warms. Previous research has found considerable spatial variability in ROS responses to climate change. Detailed global assessments have not been conducted. Here, atmospheric reanalysis data was used to drive a physically based snow hydrology model to simulate the snowpack and the streamflow response to climate warming of a 5.25 km2 virtual basin (VB) applied to different high mountain climates around the world. Results confirm that the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming is highly variable among sites, and also with different elevations, aspects and slopes in each basin. The hydrological model predicts a decrease in the frequency of ROS with warming in 30 out 40 of the VBs analyzed; the rest have increasing ROS. The dominant phase of precipitation, duration of snow cover and average temperature of each basin are the main factors that explain this variation in the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming. Within each basin, the largest decreases in ROS were predicted to be at lower elevations and on slopes with sunward aspects. Although the overall frequency of ROS drops, the hydrological importance of ROS is not expected to decline. Peak streamflows due to ROS are predicted to increase due to more rapid melting from enhanced energy inputs, and warmer snowpacks during future ROS.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of slope aspect on the response of snowpack to climate warming in the Pyrenees. For this purpose, data available from five automatic weather stations were used to simulate the energy and mass balance of snowpack, assuming different magnitudes of an idealized climate warming (upward shifting of 1, 2 and 3~\textdegree C the temperature series). Snow energy and mass balance were simulated using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). CRHM was used to create a model that enabled correction of the all-wave incoming radiation fluxes from the observation sites for various slope aspects (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW,W,NW and flat areas), which enabled assessment of the differential impact of climate warming on snow processes on mountain slopes. The results showed that slope aspect was responsible for substantial variability in snow accumulation and the duration of the snowpack. Simulated variability markedly increased with warmer temperature conditions. Annual maximum snow accumulation (MSA) and annual snowpack duration (ASD) showed marked sensitivity to a warming of 1~\textdegree C. Thus, the sensitivity of the MSA in flat areas ranged from 11 to 17~\% per degree C amongst the weather stations, and the ASD ranged from 11 to 20~days per degree C. There was a clear increase in the sensitivity of the snowpack to climate warming on those slopes that received intense solar radiation (S, SE and SW slopes) compared with those slopes where the incident radiation was more limited (N, NE and NW slopes). The sensitivity of the MSA and the ASD increased as the temperature increased, particularly on the most irradiated slopes. Large interannual variability was also observed. Thus, with more snow accumulation and longer duration the sensitivity of the snowpack to temperature decreased, especially on south-facing slopes.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the way in which the complex relationships among topography, climate, and forest canopy influence the spatiotemporal variability of accumulation and melting of snowpack in a subalpine valley. We used weekly to monthly snow course data and a numerical model (COUP) to estimate the snow water equivalent (SWE) at 16 sites distributed in the Alptal valley (Central Switzerland) from 1984 to 2004. From these SWE series, we derived indicators that represent the annual accumulation, the most intense annual melting events and the length of the period with snow cover. Generalized mixed linear models (GMLMs) were used to relate these indices to altitude and exposure to solar radiation, taking into account the interactions of both variables with the presence or absence of a forest cover. Regression analyses were carried out for the 20 analysed years and for specific years with particular climatic conditions during the accumulation or melting periods. On the basis of these results, we conclude that a small number of predictors are able to explain a large proportion of the observed SWE and snowmelt variability. The statistical analysis confirmed the role of a forest canopy in reducing snow accumulation. The reduction of the magnitude of snowpack below forest canopy will impact also in a lower amount of snow melted during the most intense thawing events. The role of forest in terms of the length of the snow cover season changes noticeably with altitude and exposure.},

  abstract = {Empirical sensitivity analyses are important for evaluation of the effects of a changing climate on water resources and ecosystems. Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g., forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western U.S. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R250.87, and SRT, R250.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming.},

In the United States, most of these datasets are developed using the Cooperative Observer (COOP) network of ground-based precipitation measurements, interpolation, and the Parameter\textendash Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) to map these measurements to places where data are not available. Here, we evaluate two daily datasets gridded at 1/168 resolution against independent daily observations from over 100 snow pillows in California's Sierra Nevada from 1990 to 2010. Over the entire period, the gridded datasets performed reasonably well, with median total water-year errors generally falling within 610\%. However, errors in individual storm events sometimes exceeded 50\% for the median difference across all stations, and in many cases, the same underpredicted storms appear in both datasets. Synoptic analysis reveals that these underpredicted storms coincide with 700-hPa winds from the west or northwest, which are associated with post-cold-frontal flow and disproportionately small precipitation rates in low-elevation valley locations, where the COOP stations are primarily located. This atmospheric circulation leads to a stronger than normal valley-to-mountain precipitation gradient and underestimation of actual mountain precipitation. Because of the small average number of storms (,10) reaching California each year, these individual storm misses can lead to large biases (;20\%) in total water-year precipitation and thereby significantly affect estimates of statewide water resources.},

These same regions are predominantly forested, with forests highly vulnerable to change. Here we combine a meta-analysis of observational studies across the globe with modeling to show that in regions with average December-January-February (DJF) temperatures greater than -1\textdegree C, forest cover reduces snow duration by 1\textendash 2 weeks compared to adjacent open areas. This occurs because the dominant effect of forest cover shifts from slowing snowmelt by shading the snow and blocking the wind to accelerating snowmelt from increasing longwave radiation. In many locations, midwinter melt removes forest snow before solar radiation is great enough for forest shading to matter, and with warming temperatures, midwinter melt is likely to become more widespread. This temperature-effect in forest-snow-climate interactions must be considered in representations of the combined ecohydrological system and can be used advantageously in forest management strategies.},

Record high temperatures occurred throughout the western United States during the second week of March, and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges throughout the area recorded early onsets of streamflow at this time. However, a set of nested subbasins in Yosemite National Park, California, told a more complicated story. In spite of high air temperatures, many streams draining high-elevation basins did not start flowing until later in the spring. Temperatures during early March 2004 were as high as temperatures in late March 2002, when streams at all of the monitored Yosemite basins began flowing at the same time. However, the March 2004 onset occurred before the spring equinox, when the sun was lower in the sky. Thus, shading and solar radiation differences played a much more important role in 2004, leading to differences in streamflow timing. These results suggest that as temperatures warm and spring melt shifts earlier in the season, topographic effects will play an even more important role than at present in determining snowmelt timing.},

  abstract = {A realistic description of how temperatures vary with elevation is crucial for ecosystem studies and for models of basin-scale snowmelt and spring streamflow. This paper explores surface temperature variability using temperature data from an array of 37 sensors, called the Yosemite network, which traverses both slopes of the Sierra Nevada in the vicinity of Yosemite National Park, California. These data indicate that a simple lapse rate is often a poor description of the spatial temperature structure. Rather, the spatial pattern of temperature over the Yosemite network varies considerably with synoptic conditions. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were used to identify the dominant spatial temperature patterns and how they vary in time. Temporal variations of these surface temperature patterns were correlated with large-scale weather conditions, as described by National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis data. Regression equations were used to downscale larger-scale weather parameters, such as Reanalysis winds and pressure, to the surface temperature structure over the Yosemite network. These relationships demonstrate that strong westerly winds are associated with relatively warmer temperatures on the east slope and cooler temperatures on the west slope of the Sierra, and weaker westerly winds are associated with the opposite pattern. Reanalysis data from 1948 to 2005 indicate weakening westerlies over this time period, a trend leading to relatively cooler temperatures on the east slope over decadal timescales. This trend also appears in long-term observations and demonstrates the need to consider topographic effects when examining long-term changes in mountain regions.},

  abstract = {The near-surface air temperature lapse rate is the predominant source of spatial temperature variability in mountains and controls snowfall and snowmelt regimes, glacier mass balance, and species distributions. Lapse rates are often estimated from observational data, however there is little guidance on best practices for estimating lapse rates. We use observational and synthetic datasets to evaluate the error and uncertainty in lapse rate estimates stemming from sample size, dataset noise, covariate collinearity, domain selection, and estimation methods. We find that lapse rates estimated from small sample sizes ({$<$}5) or datasets with high noise or collinearity can have errors of several \textdegree C km-1. Uncertainty in lapse rates due to non-elevation related large-scale temperature variability was reduced by correcting for spatial temperature gradients and restricting domains based on spatial clusters of stations. We generally found simple linear regression to be more robust than multiple linear regression for lapse rate estimation. Finally, lapse rates had lower error and uncertainty when estimated from a sample of topoclimatically self-similar stations. Motivated by these results, we outline a set of best practices for lapse rate estimation that include using quality controlled temperature observations from as many locations as possible within the study domain, accounting for and minimizing non-elevational sources of climatic gradients, and calculating lapse rates using simple linear regression across topoclimatically self-similar samples of stations which are roughly 80\% of the station population size.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snowpack dynamics shape the biophysical and societal characteristics of many global regions. However, snowpack accumulation and duration have generally declined in recent decades, largely due to anthropogenic climate change. Mechanistic understanding of snowpack spatiotemporal heterogeneity and climate change impacts will benefit from snow data products that are based on physical principles, simulated at high spatial resolution, and cover large geographic domains. Most existing datasets do not meet these requirements, hindering our ability to understand both contemporary and changing snow regimes and to develop adaptation strategies in regions where snowpack patterns and processes are important components of Earth systems.  We developed a computationally efficient process-based snow model, SnowClim, that can be run in the cloud. The model was evaluated and calibrated at Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites across the western United States (US), achieving a site-median root-mean-squared error for daily snow water equivalent (SWE) of 64 mm, bias in peak SWE of -2.6 mm, and bias in snow duration of -4.5 d when run hourly. Positive biases were found at sites with mean winter temperature above freezing where the estimation of precipitation phase is prone to errors. The model was applied to the western US (a domain covering 3.1 million square kilometers) using newly developed forcing data created by statistically downscaling pre-industrial, historical, and pseudo-global warming climate data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The resulting product is the SnowClim dataset, a suite of summary climate and snow metrics, including monthly SWE and snow depth, as well as annual maximum SWE and snow cover duration, for the western US at 210 m spatial resolution (Lute et al., 2021). The physical basis, large extent, and high spatial resolution of this dataset enable novel analyses of changing hydroclimate and its implications for natural and human systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) based on remote sensing have been elusive, particularly in mountain areas. However, there now appears to be some potential for direct satellite-based SWE observations along ground tracks that only cover a portion of a spatial domain (e.g., watershed). Fortunately, spatiotemporally continuous meteorological and surface variables could be leveraged to infer SWE in the gaps between satellite ground tracks. Here, we evaluate statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches to performing track-to-area (TTA) transformations of SWE observations in California's upper Tuolumne River watershed using synthetic data. The synthetic SWE measurements are designed to mimic a potential future P-band Signals of Opportunity (P-SoOP) satellite mission with a (along-track) spatial resolution of about 500\,m. We construct relationships between multiple meteorological and surface variables and synthetic SWE observations along observation tracks, and we then extend these relationships to unobserved areas between ground tracks to estimate SWE over the entire watershed. Domain-wide, SWE inferred on 1~April using two synthetic satellite tracks ({$\sim$}4.5\,\% basin coverage) led to percent errors of basin-averaged SWE (PEBAS) of 24.5\,\%, 4.5\,\% and 6.3\,\% in an extremely dry water year (WY2015), a normal water year (WY2008) and an extraordinarily wet water year (WY2017), respectively. Assuming a 10\,d overpass interval, percent errors of basin-averaged SWE during both snow accumulation and snowmelt seasons were mostly less than 10\,\%. We employ a feature sensitivity analysis to overcome the black-box nature of ML methods and increase the explainability of the ML results. Our feature sensitivity analysis shows that precipitation is the dominant variable controlling the TTA SWE estimation, followed by net long-wave radiation (NetLong). We find that a modest increase in the accuracy of SWE estimation occurs when more than two ground tracks are leveraged. The accuracy of 1~April SWE estimation is only modestly improved for track repeats more often than about 15\,d.},

Early estimates based on 1 April snow course data indicate that the snowpack drought deficit will not be overcome in 2016, despite historically strong El Ni\~no conditions.

  abstract = {A new snow reanalysis method is presented that is designed to jointly assimilate Landsat- and MODIS-derived (MODSCAG) fractional snow covered area (fSCA) to characterize seasonal snow in remote regions like High Mountain Asia (HMA) where in situ data is severely lacking. The method leverages existing readily available global datasets for forcing a snow model and uses the fSCA retrievals along with the ensemble prior model estimates to derive posterior estimates using a Bayesian framework. The method addresses MODIS viewing-geometry effects on the fSCA retrievals by accounting for viewing angle dependent measurement errors and using a CDF-matching technique to improve the joint fSCA measurement consistency before assimilation. The method was verified through comparison with the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates over the Tuolumne River watershed in California. The posterior SWE estimates were shown to be much more consistent with the independent ASO estimates across the three WYs examined. Tests over Tuolumne showed that in cases where sufficient Landsat observations are available (i.e., with multiple sensors and in areas of overlapping Landsat tiles), assimilation of only Landsat data may be optimal, which is attributable primarily to the higher spatial resolution of the raw Landsat data, but that in cases with fewer Landsat measurements (i.e., with single Landsat tiles and/or significant reduction due to clouds), the additional screened and CDF-matched MODIS-based measurements can have a positive (albeit marginal) impact. Illustrative results are presented for nine HMA test tiles to illustrate how the method can provide posterior estimates of the space-time climatology of SWE storage in areas where in situ data does not generally exist. Ongoing work is being conducted to use the method outlined herein to generate an HMA-wide reanalysis dataset that will provide an opportunity for a more thorough characterization of HMA seasonal snow storage and dynamics over the joint Landsat-MODIS era. The method is generalizable to any midlatitude montane region where seasonal snow is important.},

The method (fully Bayesian), resolution (daily and 90 m), temporal extent (31 years), and accuracy provide a unique dataset for investigating snow processes. The verified dataset (based on a comparison with over 9000 station years of in situ data) exhibited mean and rootmean-square errors less than 3 and 13 cm, respectively, and correlation greater than 0.95 compared with in situ SWE observations. The reanalysis dataset was used to characterize the peak SWE climatology to provide a basic accounting of the stored snowpack water in the Sierra Nevada over the last 31 years. The pixel-wise peak SWE volume over the domain was found to be 20.0 km3 on average with a range of 4.0\textendash 40.6 km3. The ongoing drought in California contains the two lowest snowpack years (water years 2014 and 2015) and three of the four driest years over the examined record. It was found that the basin-average peak SWE, while underestimating the total water storage in snowpack over the year, accurately captures the interannual variability in stored snowpack water. However, the results showed that the assumption that 1 April SWE is representative of the peak SWE can lead to significant underestimation of basin-average peak SWE both on an average (21\% across all basins) and on an interannual basis (up to 98\% across all basin years).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a newly proposed data assimilation method for historical snow water equivalent SWE estimation using remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area fSCA. The newly proposed approach consists of a particle batch smoother (PBS), which is compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27-yr Landsat 5 record at snow pillow and snow course in situ verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates, with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The prior RMSE values at the snow pillow and snow course sites were reduced by 68\%\textendash 82\% and 60\%\textendash 68\%, respectively, when applying the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBS RMSE was ;54\% of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the PBS RMSE was ;79\% of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS to the mean prior precipitation input, especially in the case where significant prior biases exist.},

  abstract = {Abstract Significant differences in snow deposition, development of the seasonal snow cover, and the timing of melt can occur over small spatial distances because of differences in topographically controlled wind exposure and canopy cover. To capture important intrabasin hydrological processes related to heterogeneous snow cover and energy inputs, models must explicitly account for these differences. The ``SNOBAL'' point snow cover energy and mass balance model is used to evaluate differences in snow cover energy and mass balance at two sites in a small headwater drainage of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho. Though these sites are separated by only 350 m, they are located in distinctly different snow cover regimes. The ``ridge'' site (elevation 2097 m) is located on a broad shelf on the southern ridge of RCEW, and the ``grove'' site (elevation 2061 m) is sheltered by topography and forest canopy in a grove of aspen and fir trees just in the lee of the ridge on which the ridge site is located. Precipitation and climate data from these sites were used to drive SNOBAL for three water years: the 1984 water year, the largest discharge year on record; the 1992 water year, the smallest discharge year on record; and the very windy 1999 water year. Simulated energy balance during meltout at the ridge site was dominated by sensible heat flux; at the grove site the primary energy input during meltout was net allwave radiation. Comparison of total annual snowmelt with measured stream discharge from this headwater drainage showed that neither site adequately represented the basin input of water in any of the model years. This analysis details the disparity in energy and mass fluxes during the snow accumulation and ablation cycle between two proximal sites, illustrating the importance of understanding and spatially accounting for variable energy inputs and snow deposition patterns.},

  abstract = {In mountainous regions, topographic structure and vegetation control patterns of snow deposition, climate conditions, and snowmelt. A topographically distributed snow accumulation and melt model (ISNOBAL) was coupled to a wind field and snow redistribution model to simulate the development and ablation of the seasonal snow cover over a small mountainous catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East basin (0{$\cdot$}38 km2) in southwestern Idaho, USA. The model was driven by hourly terrain- and canopy-corrected data grids derived from meteorological data from two stations located within the catchment for four water years (1986, 1987, 1989 and 1997). The catchment was divided into four shelter classes, based on terrain and vegetation; these were used for an analysis of how the mass and energy balance of the snowcover varies over the basin as a function of terrain and forest characteristics for each of the selected years. As shown by the simulations and verified by detailed point measurements and the late-season areal photographs of snow-covered area, in all years the wind-exposed areas developed thinner snow covers and were essentially bare of snow prior to the onset of spring meltout in wind-sheltered areas. The meltout of the wind-sheltered drift and canopy-enclosed regions occurred in conjunction with the springtime increase in solar radiation generating the bulk of springtime runoff. Melt contributions from the drifts may continue into the late spring and early summer. This research uses a unique set of point and spatial verification data to show that a snow accumulation and ablation model, adjusted for wind redistribution effects, reliably simulated the topographic and vegetation influences on snow distribution, the energy balance, and the hydrology of snow and wind-dominated mountainous regions.

  abstract = {Abstract             Throughout the western US snow melted at an alarming rate in April 2021 and by May 1, hydrologic conditions were severely degraded with declining summer water supply forecasts compared to earlier in the winter. The objectives of this study are to (a) quantify the magnitude and climatological context of observed melt rates of snow water equivalent (SWE) and (b) underpin the hydrometeorological drivers during April 2021 based on atmospheric reanalysis and gridded meteorological data. Peak SWE indicated snow drought conditions were widespread (41\% of stations between 5th and 20th percentile) but not necessarily extreme (only 9\% of stations less than 5th percentile). Here, using observations from the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network we found record 7 day snow melt rates (median of -99 mm; {$\pm$}one standard deviation of 61 mm) occurred at 24\% of SNOTEL sites and in all 11 Western states. Strong upper atmospheric ridging that began initially in the north Pacific with eastward propagation by mid-April to the Pacific Northwest Coast led to near-surface conditions across the western US conducive to rapid snow loss. One heat wave occurred inland across the Rockies the first week of April and then later in April, a second heat wave impacted the Cascades and northern California. We find that ripening of the snowpack by both record high surface solar radiation and air temperatures were factors in driving the rapid snow melt. Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures and the La Ni\~na pattern that peaked in winter along with an eastward propagating and intensifying Madden\textendash Julian Oscillation were likely responsible for driving the placement, strength, and progression of the north Pacific Ridge. This study documents the role of two extreme spring `sunny heat wave' events on snowpack, and the cascading drought impacts which are anticipated to become more frequent in a warming world.},

  abstract = {Hydraulic connectivity on hillslopes and the existence of preferred soil moisture states in a catchment have important controls on runoff generation. In this study we investigate the relationships between soil moisture patterns, lateral hillslope flow, and streamflow generation in a semi-arid, snowmelt-driven catchment. We identify five soil moisture conditions that occur during a year and present a conceptual model based on field studies and computer simulations of how streamflow is generated with respect to the soil moisture conditions. The five soil moisture conditions are (1) a summer dry period, (2) a transitional fall wetting period, (3) a winter wet, low-flux period, (4) a spring wet, high-flux period, and (5) a transitional late-spring drying period. Transitions between the periods are driven by changes in the water balance between rain, snow, snowmelt and evapotranspiration. Low rates of water input to the soil during the winter allow dry soil regions to persist at the soil\textendash bedrock interface, which act as barriers to lateral flow. Once the dry-soil flow barriers are wetted, whole-slope hydraulic connectivity is established, lateral flow can occur, and upland soils are in direct connection with the near-stream soil moisture. This whole-slope connectivity can alter near-stream hydraulics and modify the delivery of water, pressure, and solutes to the stream. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The utility of differentially mapping snow depth to assess snow water resources at the watershed scale has been demonstrated using snow-free and snow-on lidar surface elevations. On more limited spatial and temporal scales, the same principle has been successfully applied with the relatively new photogrammetric technique Structure from Motion (SfM). Given the low cost of cameras relative to lidar technology, early studies are promising, yet it is well known that reconstructing elevations over bright snow surfaces in complex terrain has been a limitation for traditional photogrammetric methods. Therefore, before progressing to snow depth, it is worthwhile to constrain how well snow surface elevations are mapped with SfM. The lidar-based Airborne Snow Observatory, which also has an RGB camera, provides a unique opportunity to assess SfM against coincidentally collected lidar. Here we present a lidar-SfM snow surface elevation comparison from the 21 February 2017 flight, which took place in Senator Beck Basin, San Juan Mountains, CO, during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) SnowEx campaign (Year 1). After coregistration of the two surface models, the normalized median absolute deviation was 0.17 m with a mean relative elevation difference of 0.014 m at identical spatial resolution of 1 m. The digital surface model was created without the use of ground control points, shows a promising potential to apply SfM for watershed-scale surface elevation and snow depth mapping, and warrants further investigation of SfM as a supplement or alternative to lidar.},

  abstract = {High-resolution gridded datasets of meteorological variables are needed in order to resolve fine-scale hydrological gradients in complex mountainous terrain. Across the United States, the highest available spatial resolution of gridded datasets of daily meteorological records is approximately 800 m. This work presents gridded datasets of daily precipitation and mean temperature for the East\textendash Taylor subbasin (in the western United States) covering a 12-year period (2008\textendash 2019) at a high spatial resolution (400 m). The datasets are generated using a downscaling framework that uses data-driven models to learn relationships between climate variables and topography. We observe that downscaled datasets of precipitation and mean temperature exhibit smoother spatial gradients (while preserving the spatial variability) when compared to their coarser counterparts. Additionally, we also observe that when downscaled datasets are upscaled to the original resolution (800 m), the mean residual error is almost zero, ensuring no bias when compared with the original data. Furthermore, the downscaled datasets are observed to be linearly related to elevation, which is consistent with the methodology underlying the original 800 m product. Finally, we validate the spatial patterns exhibited by downscaled datasets via an example use case that models lidar-derived estimates of snowpack. The presented dataset constitutes a valuable resource to resolve fine-scale hydrological gradients in the mountainous terrain of the East\textendash Taylor subbasin, which is an important study area in the context of water security for the southwestern United States and Mexico.

At both sites, vegetation structure largely controlled the distribution of snow accumulation with 29\% greater accumulation in open versus under-canopy locations. Snow ablation rates were diminished by 39\% in under-canopy locations, indicating increases in vegetation density act to extend the duration of the snowmelt season. Similarly, differences in climate altered snow-season duration, snowmelt infiltration and evapotranspiration. Commencement of the growing season was coincident with melt-water input to the soil and lagged behind springtime increases in air temperature by 12 days on average, ranging from 2 to 33 days under warmer and colder conditions, respectively. Similarly, the timing of peak soil moisture was highly variable, lagging behind springtime increases in air temperature by 42 and 31 days on average at the Colorado and New Mexico sites, respectively. Latent heat flux and associated evaporative loss to the atmosphere was 28\% greater for the year with earlier onset of snowmelt infiltration. Given the large and variable fraction of precipitation that was partitioned into water vapour loss, the combined effects of changes in vegetation structure, climate and associated changes to the timing and magnitude of snowmelt may have large effects on the partitioning of snowmelt into evapotranspiration, surface runoff and ground water recharge.

In this reconstruction approach, modeled snowmelt over each pixel is integrated during the period of satellite-observed snow cover to estimate SWE. Due to underestimates in snow cover detection, maximum basin-wide mean SWE using MODIS and AVHRR were, respectively, 45\% and 68\% lower than SWE estimates obtained using ETM+ data. The mean absolute error (MAE) of SWE estimated at 100-m resolution using ETM+ data was 23\% relative to observed SWE from intensive field campaigns. Model performance deteriorated when MODIS (MAE = 50\%) and AVHRR (MAE = 89\%) SCA data were used. Relative to differences in the SCA products, model output was less sensitive to spatial resolution (MAE = 39\% and 73\% for ETM+ and MODIS simulations run at 1 km resolution, respectively), indicating that SWE reconstructions at the scale of MODIS acquisitions may be tractable provided the SCA product is improved. When considering tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors, our results indicate that higher spatial resolution products such as ETM+ remain more accurate despite the lower frequency of acquisition. This motivates continued efforts to improve MODIS snow cover products.},

  abstract = {The persistence of snow cover across mountainous landscapes influences land-atmosphere energy exchange, water availability, the partitioning of snowmelt into various hydrologic pathways, vegetation productivity, and fluxes of nutrients. Understanding the processes controlling snow cover persistence has been limited as relationships between physiography, climate, and snow persistence are nonlinear and difficult to characterize empirically. The work detailed herein uses 7 years of remotely sensed snow cover persistence observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer over the Sierra Nevada Mountains as a dependent variable in binary regression tree models with a suite of independent variables comprised of both physiographic and climatic metrics. Annual snow cover persistence over 2001\textendash 2007 revealed significant inter-annual variability, with domainaverage snow persistence values exceeding 4.01 (i.e. early April) in the wettest year of 2005 and reaching as low as 2.90 (i.e. late February) in the driest year of 2007. Regression tree models revealed that elevation was the most important explanatory variable regarding snow cover persistence, ranking first in the hierarchical models in 10 out of 13 watersheds. Precipitation (Feather and Owens River basins) and temperature (Kern River basin) were the first-ranking variables in the remaining three watersheds. Second, the order variables of importance included vegetation, which ranked between 2nd and 5th in 10 of 13 watersheds, and slope, which ranked 4th and 5th in 12 of the 13 watersheds. Interestingly, solar radiation and aspect were of tertiary importance but were more influential in watersheds with north\textendash south orientation (e.g. in the Feather, Mokelumne and Stanislaus watersheds). These results have implications for understanding the sensitivity of snow cover persistence to changes in climate as watersheds where elevation and/or temperature strongly influence snow cover persistence may be more sensitive to future warming. Further work is needed to identify associated ecosystem sensitivities to future changes in snow cover persistence. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In some cases, SNOTEL SWE values were 200\% greater than mean grid element SWE. Analyses designed to identify the optimal location for measuring mean grid element SWE accumulation indicated that only 2.4\% of each grid element satisfied the criteria of optimality. Similar analyses for the ablation season showed that point SWE and mean grid element SWE were highly correlated (r = 0.73) in areas with relatively persistent snow cover. These locations did not overlap in space with areas deemed optimal at maximum accumulation; areas with persistent snow cover have relatively high accumulation rates. Therefore future observations may need to be placed with the specific objective of representing either accumulation or ablation season processes. These results have implications for large-scale studies that require ground observations for updating purposes; we show an example of this utility using the SWE product of the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center. Furthermore, the relatively consistent spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt have implications for future observation network design in that results from short-term studies (e.g., 2 years) can be used to design long-term observation networks.},

Over 80\% of measurement sites west of 115\textdegree W experienced record low snowpack in 2015, and we estimate a return period of 400\textendash 1000 years for California's snowpack under the questionable assumption of stationarity. Hydrologic modeling supports the conclusion that 2015 was the most severe on record by a wide margin. Using a crowd-sourced superensemble of regional climate model simulations, we show that both human influence and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies contributed strongly to the risk of snow drought in Oregon and Washington: the contribution of SST anomalies was about twice that of human influence. By contrast, SSTs and humans appear to have played a smaller role in creating California's snow drought. In all three states, the anthropogenic effect on temperature exacerbated the snow drought.},

  abstract = {The utility of airborne scanning LiDAR data to estimate solar direct beam canopy transmittance in complex, forested terrain was evaluated. Twenty-four hemispherical photos were used to produce ground-based estimates of solar direct beam canopy transmittance. The photo estimates were used to develop and evaluate two spatially distributed canopy transmittance models: 1) a Beer's Law-type transmittance model based on LiDAR-derived canopy metrics, and 2) a solar raytrace model applied to a three-dimensional canopy model. The models were used to estimate solar direct beam canopy transmittance at five-minute resolution for all days between the winter and summer solstices over an 800 m by 700 m domain at 1 m horizontal grid spacing. When compared to estimates from hemispherical photos, the raytrace model resolved the complex seasonal and diurnal variability of solar direct beam canopy transmittance resulting from individual trees and localized canopy structure. The Beer's-type model was unable to resolve these detailed factors. The two models exhibited similar and relatively low normalized daily mean error values from December to early March. Later in the season (01 March\textendash 21 June), the model differences were pronounced; the daily mean and standard deviation of the error values for the Beer's-type and raytrace models were 13\% {$\pm$} 10\% and 8\% {$\pm$} 6\%, respectively. The results confirm previously known limitations of Beer's Law when used to estimate sub-canopy solar beam irradiance under heterogeneous canopy conditions. Averaged over the spatial domain, the Beer's-type model estimated 21\% and 48\% lower canopy transmittance than the raytrace model on 01 March and 03 May, respectively. The Beer's-type model was unable to represent the seasonal increase in areal average canopy transmission contributed from small canopy gaps. Finally, both distributed models were used to simulate the cumulative solar beam irradiance during the 2010 snowmelt season. The raytrace model was shown to capture a high level of variability necessary to simulate explicit stand-scale solar irradiance that strongly influences spatiotemporal patterns of snowmelt, soil water availability, and the partition and exchange of energy within heterogeneous forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In a warmer climate, the fraction of annual meltwater produced at high melt rates in mountainous areas is projected to decline due to a contraction of the snow-cover season, causing melt to occur earlier and under lower energy conditions. How snowmelt rates, including extreme events relevant to flood risk, may respond to a range of warming over a mountain front is poorly known. We present a model sensitivity study of snowmelt response to warming across a 3600 m elevation gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada, USA. A snow model was run for three distinct years and verified against extensive ground observations. To simulate the impact of climate warming on meltwater production, measured meteorological conditions were modified by +1 to +6 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. The total annual snow water volume exhibited linear reductions (-10 \% {$\smwhtcircle$}C-1) consistent with previous studies. However, the sensitivity of snowmelt rates to successive degrees of warming varied nonlinearly with elevation. Middle elevations and years with more snowfall were prone to the largest reductions in snowmelt rates, with lesser changes simulated at higher elevations. Importantly, simulated warming causes extreme daily snowmelt (99th percentiles) to increase in spatial extent and intensity, and shift from spring to winter. The results offer insight into the sensitivity of mountain snow water resources and how the rate and timing of water availability may change in a warmer climate. The identification of future climate conditions that may increase extreme melt events is needed to address the climate resilience of regional flood control systems.},

  abstract = {One of the most visible and widely felt impacts of climate warming is the change (mostly loss) of low-elevation snow cover in the midlatitudes. Snow cover that accumulates at temperatures close to the ice-water phase transition is at greater risk to climate warming than cold climate snowpacks because it affects both precipitation phase and ablation rates. This study maps areas in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States that are potentially at risk of converting from a snow-dominated to a rain-dominated winter precipitation regime, under a climate-warming scenario. A data-driven, climatological approach of snow cover classification is used to reveal these ``at risk'' snow zones and also to examine the relative frequency of warm winters for the region. For a rain versus snow temperature threshold of 0\textdegree C the at-risk snow class covers an area of about 9200 km2 in the Pacific Northwest region and represents approximately 6.5 km3 of water. Many areas of the Pacific Northwest would see an increase in the number of warm winters, but the impacts would likely be concentrated in the Cascade and Olympic Ranges. A number of lowerelevation ski areas could experience negative impacts because of the shift from winter snows to winter rains. The results of this study point to the potential for using existing datasets to better understand the potential impacts of climate warming.},

  abstract = {Snow is Earth's most climatically sensitive land cover type. Traditional snow metrics may not be able to adequately capture the changing nature of snow cover. For example, April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) has been an effective index for streamflow forecasting, but it cannot express the effects of midwinter melt events, now expected in warming snow climates, nor can we assume that station-based measurements will be representative of snow conditions in future decades. Remote sensing and climate model data provide capacity for a suite of multi-use snow metrics from local to global scales. Such indicators need to be simple enough to ``tell the story'' of snowpack changes over space and time, but not overly simplistic or overly complicated in their interpretation. We describe a suite of spatially explicit, multi-temporal snow metrics based on global satellite data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and downscaled climate model output for the U.S. We describe and provide examples for Snow Cover Frequency (SCF), Snow Disappearance Date (SDD), At-Risk Snow (ARS), and Frequency of a Warm Winter (FWW). Using these retrospective and prospective snow metrics, we assess the current and future snow-related conditions in three hydroclimatically different U.S. watersheds: the Truckee, Colorado Headwaters, and Upper Connecticut. In the two western U.S. watersheds, SCF and SDD show greater sensitivity to annual differences in snow cover compared with data from the ground-based Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The eastern U.S. watershed does not have a ground-based network of data, so these MODIS-derived metrics provide uniquely valuable snow information. The ARS and FWW metrics show that the Truckee Watershed is highly vulnerable to conversion from snowfall to rainfall (ARS) and midwinter melt events (FWW) throughout the seasonal snow zone. In comparison, the Colorado Headwaters and Upper Connecticut Watersheds are colder and much less vulnerable through mid- and late-century.},

By using MODIS products from 2000 to 2018, this study reveals that around 78\% of the global mountain areas are undergoing a snow decline characterized by snow cover duration decrease up to 43~days, and a snow cover area decrease up to 13\%. Few areas show positive changes with snow cover duration increase up to 32~days, and snow cover area increase up to 11\%, mainly during wintertime in Northern Hemisphere. Significant snow cover duration changes are related in 58\% of the areas to both delayed snow onset, and earlier melt; moreover, the rate of earlier snowmelt is greater than the rate of later snow onset in the analyzed time period. Snow cover, and phenology changes are highly variable at mid-elevations, while from 4000~m upward only negative changes are detected. Air temperature is the main driver for snow onset and melt, while a combined effect of air temperature and precipitation dominates the winter season. These changes have multiple implications on water resources, ecosystem services, tourism, and energy production. The results are provided with the caveats that the short time period of the analysis (2000\textendash 2018) limit the attributions of long-term trends, and snow cover estimates are affected by uncertainties, which may be stronger in complex terrain.},

Radiative flux components are simulated for the Tekapo watershed at 100-m resolution for clear-sky summer days, using a surface radiation budget model in conjunction with satellite imagery and topographic modeling to derive surface parameters. Overall, the model results agree well with observations made at a range of sites, with shortwave fluxes simulated more accurately than longwave fluxes. Sensitivity studies were conducted to isolate the role of spatial variability of surface characteristics in generating variance in the radiation budget. In order of most to least important, these characteristics were found to be slope aspect, slope angle, elevation, albedo, shading, sky view factor, and leaf area index. Spatial variability was greatest in midmorning and midafternoon, as a function of optical depth. The role of landscape complexity in the spatial distribution of fluxes was investigated by considering three subareas of the watershed that contain strongly contrasting scales of autocorrelation of topography and surface cover. Increase in topographical complexity yielded a small decrease in spatial average net radiation and a large increase in spatial standard deviation, driven most significantly by incident shortwave radiation. The regional averages scaled more or less linearly, whereas subregional-scale spatial variability differed dramatically.},

Precipitation events in the Sierra Nevada region occur mostly during wintertime, irrespective of station location (leeside or windside) and elevation. Most precipitation episodes in the region are associated with moist southwesterly winds (coming from the southwest direction) and also tend to occur when the 700-mbar temperature at the upwind direction is close to -2\textdegree C. This favored wind direction and temperature signify the importance of both moisture transport and orographic lifting in augmenting precipitation in the region. By utilizing the observed dependency of the precipitation upon the upper air conditions, a linear model is formulated to quantify the precipitation observed at different sites as a function of moisture transport. The skill of the model increases with timescale of aggregation, reaching more than 50\% variance explained at an aggregation period of 5\textendash 7 days. This indicates that upstream air moisture transport can be used to estimate the precipitation totals in the Sierra Nevada region.},

  abstract = {In this study, the influence of climate change to California and Nevada regions was investigated through high-resolution (4-km grid spacing) dynamical downscaling using the WRF (Weather Research \& Forecasting) model. The dynamical downscaling was performed to both the GFS (Global forecast model) reanalysis (called GFS-WRF runs) from 2000\textendash 2006 and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) simulations (called PCM-WRF runs) from 1997\textendash 2006 and 2047\textendash 2056. The downscaling results were first validated by comparing current model outputs with the observational analysis PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) dataset. In general, the dominant features from GFS-WRF runs and PCM-WRF runs were consistent with each other, as well as with PRISM results. The influences of climate change on the California and Nevada regions can be inferred from the model future runs. The averaged temperature showed a positive trend in the future, as in other studies. The temperature increases by around 1\textendash 2\textdegree C under the assumption of business as usual over 50~years. This leads to an upward shifting of the freezing level (the contour line of 0\textdegree C temperature) and more rain instead of snow in winter (December, January, and February). More hot days ({$>$}32.2\textdegree C or 90\textdegree F) and extreme hot days ({$>$}37.8\textdegree C or 100\textdegree F) are predicted in the Sacramento Valley and the southern parts of California and Nevada during summer (June, July, and August). More precipitation is predicted in northern California but not in southern California. Rainfall frequency slightly increases in the coast regions, but not in the inland area.

The spatial distributions of precipitation frequency from GFS-WRF and PCM-WRF were highly correlated (r~=~0.83). However, overall positive shifts were seen in the temperature field; increases of 2\textdegree C for California and 3\textdegree C for Nevada in summer and 2.5\textdegree C for California and 1.5\textdegree C for Nevada in winter. The PDFs predicted higher precipitation in winter and lower precipitation in the summer for both California and Nevada.},

  abstract = {The depth and timing of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains are of fundamental importance to California water resource availability, and recent studies indicate a shift toward earlier snowmelt consistent with projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In order for future studies to assess snowpack variability on seasonal to centennial time scales, physically based models of snowpack evolution at high spatial resolution must be improved. Here we evaluate modeled snowpack accuracy for the central Sierra Nevada in the Weather Research and Forecasting regional climate model coupled to the Noah land surface model. A simulation with nested domains at 27, 9, and 3 km grid spacings is presented for November 2001 to July 2002. Model outputs are compared with daily snowpack observations at 41 locations, air temperature at 31 locations, and precipitation at 10 locations. Comparison of snowpack at different resolutions suggests that 27 km simulations substantially underestimate snowpack, while 9 and 3 km simulations are closer to observations. Regional snowpack accumulation is accurately simulated at these high resolutions, but model snowmelt occurs an average of 22\textendash 25 days early. Some error can be traced to differences in elevation and observation scale between point-based measurements and model grid cells, but these factors cannot explain the persistent bias toward early snowmelt. A high correlation between snowmelt and error in modeled surface air temperature is found, with melt coinciding systematically with excessively cold air temperatures. One possible source of bias is an imbalance in turbulent heat fluxes, erroneously warming the snowpack while cooling the surface atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Climate warming will likely cause a shift from snow to rain in midlatitude mountains. Because rain falls faster than snow, it is not advected as far by prevailing winds before reaching the ground. A shift in precipitation phase thus may alter precipitation patterns. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model at 27-9-3 km resolutions over the California Sierra Nevada, we conducted an idealized experiment consisting of a present climate control run and two additional simulations in which (a) fall speed for snow is similar to rain and (b) all precipitation is constrained to fall as liquid. Rather than simulating future climates directly, these perturbation experiments allow us to test the potential impacts of changing precipitation phase in isolation from other factors such as variable large-scale atmospheric circulation. Relative to the control, both perturbations result in a rain shadow deepened by {$\sim$}30\textendash 60\%, with increased focusing of precipitation on the western Sierra Nevada slopes best resolved at {$\leq$}9 km resolutions. Our results suggest that altered precipitation phase associated with climate change will likely affect spatial distributions of water resources, floods, and landslides in the Sierra Nevada and similar midlatitude mountain ranges.},

  abstract = {Soil-mantled pole-facing hillslopes on Earth tend to be steeper, wetter, and have more vegetation cover compared with adjacent equator-facing hillslopes. These and other slope aspect controls are often the consequence of feedbacks among hydrologic, ecologic, pedogenic, and geomorphic processes triggered by spatial variations in mean annual insolation. In this paper we review the state of knowledge on slope aspect controls of Critical Zone (CZ) processes using the latitudinal and elevational dependence of topographic asymmetry as a motivating observation. At relatively low latitudes and elevations, pole-facing hillslopes tend to be steeper. At higher latitudes and elevations this pattern reverses. We reproduce this pattern using an empirical model based on parsimonious functions of latitude, an aridity index, mean-annual temperature, and slope gradient. Using this empirical model and the literature as guides, we present a conceptual model for the slope-aspect-driven CZ feedbacks that generate asymmetry in water-limited and temperature-limited end-member cases. In this conceptual model the dominant factor driving slope aspect differences at relatively low latitudes and elevations is the difference in mean-annual soil moisture. The dominant factor at higher latitudes and elevations is temperature limitation on vegetation growth. In water-limited cases, we propose that higher mean-annual soil moisture on pole-facing hillslopes drives higher soil production rates, higher water storage potential, more vegetation cover, faster dust deposition, and lower erosional efficiency in a positive feedback. At higher latitudes and elevations, pole-facing hillslopes tend to have less vegetation cover, greater erosional efficiency, and gentler slopes, thus reversing the pattern of asymmetry found at lower latitudes and elevations. Our conceptual model emphasizes the linkages among short- and long-timescale processes and across CZ sub-disciplines; it also points to opportunities to further understand how CZ processes interact. We also demonstrate the importance of paleoclimatic conditions and non-climatic factors in influencing slope aspect variations. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {AbstractQuantifying rates of climate change in mountain regions is of considerable interest, not least because mountains are viewed as climate ``hotspots'' where change can anticipate or amplify what is occurring elsewhere. Accelerating mountain climate change has extensive environmental impacts, including depletion of snow/ice reserves, critical for the world's water supply. Whilst the concept of elevation-dependent warming (EDW), whereby warming rates are stratified by elevation, is widely accepted, no consistent EDW profile at the global scale has been identified. Past assessments have also neglected elevation-dependent changes in precipitation. In this comprehensive analysis, both in situ station temperature and precipitation data from mountain regions, and global gridded data sets (observations, reanalyses, and model hindcasts) are employed to examine the elevation dependency of temperature and precipitation changes since 1900. In situ observations in paired studies (using adjacent stations) show a tendency toward enhanced warming at higher elevations. However, when all mountain/lowland studies are pooled into two groups, no systematic difference in high versus low elevation group warming rates is found. Precipitation changes based on station data are inconsistent with no systematic contrast between mountain and lowland precipitation trends. Gridded data sets (CRU, GISTEMP, GPCC, ERA5, and CMIP5) show increased warming rates at higher elevations in some regions, but on a global scale there is no universal amplification of warming in mountains. Increases in mountain precipitation are weaker than for low elevations worldwide, meaning reduced elevation-dependency of precipitation, especially in midlatitudes. Agreement on elevation-dependent changes between gridded data sets is weak for temperature but stronger for precipitation.},

Using comprehensive, homogeneity-adjusted temperature records from over 1000 high elevation stations across the globe, we examine the causes of changing temperature trends with elevation, assessing the roles of free atmospheric change, topography (exposure and aspect), and cryospheric feedback. The data show that observed 20th century temperature trends are most rapid near the annual 0\textdegree C isotherm due to snow-ice feedback. Mountain summit and freely draining slope sites are dominated by free-air advection and thus have consistent trend magnitudes, with reduced inter-site variance in comparison with incised valley sites where local factors are more important. Thus, while there has been no simplistic elevational increase in warming rates, some generalizations can be made. Water resources and ecosystems near the 0\textdegree C isotherm in the extratropics are at increased risk from accelerated warming. The data also suggest that exposed mountain summits, away from the effects of urbanization and topographic sheltering, may provide a relatively unbiased record of the planet's climate.},

These observations are needed to better understand the transient surface energy balance, influenced by near-surface air temperatures and water fluxes ranging from evapotranspiration to snowmelt. From geostationary orbit, the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument views the Earth from a fixed longitude above the equator. ABI images therefore have increasingly off-nadir view angles and increasingly larger pixel dimensions the further a point on the Earth's surface is from the sub-satellite point. In thermal infrared imagery from ABI, these 2+ km pixels blur together the different surface temperatures of heterogeneous mountain landscapes. We compared GOES-16 ABI band 14 (11.2~{$\mu$}m) brightness temperatures to 90~m spatial resolution ASTER band 14 (11.3~{$\mu$}m) and 1~km spatial resolution MODIS band 31 (11.03~{$\mu$}m) brightness temperatures and investigated how differences change over space and time for a study region in the central Sierra Nevada of California for the 2017\textendash 2020 snow seasons. We demonstrated the necessity of orthorectifying ABI imagery of mountain terrain to correct for the parallax effect in off-nadir imagery. This reduced the mean difference between ABI and ASTER \textasciitilde 11~{$\mu$}m brightness temperatures from 1.6~\textdegree C to 1.0~\textdegree C and increased the r-squared value between ABI and ASTER thermal infrared brightness temperatures from 0.43 to 0.93. The ABI brightness temperatures were found to more closely match those of forest canopy temperatures than snow surface (with RMS differences of 1.2~\textdegree C and 3.0~\textdegree C respectively), and those of sunlit slopes as opposed to slopes facing away from the sun (with RMS differences of 1.6~\textdegree C and 3.4~\textdegree C respectively), in coincident ASTER imagery. This work demonstrates the use of GOES ABI, and associated challenges, for observing surface temperatures of forested mountain environments with seasonal snow.},

  abstract = {Ephemeral snowpacks, or those that persist for \&lt; 60 continuous days, are challenging to observe and model because snow accumulation and ablation occur during the same season. This has left ephemeral snow understudied, despite its widespread extent. Using 328 site years from the Great Basin, we show that ephemeral snowmelt causes a 70-days-earlier soil moisture response than seasonal snowmelt. In addition, deep soil moisture response was more variable in areas with seasonal snowmelt. To understand Great Basin snow distribution, we used MODIS and Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) data to map snow extent. Estimates of maximum continuous snow cover duration from SNODAS consistently overestimated MODIS observations by \&gt;25 days in the lowest (\&lt;1500\&thinsp;m) and highest (\&gt;2500\&thinsp;m) elevations. During this time period snowpack was highly variable. The maximum seasonal snow cover during water years 2005\textendash 2014 was 64\&thinsp;\% in 2010 and at a minimum of 24\&thinsp;\% in 2014. We found that elevation had a strong control on snow ephemerality, and nearly all snowpacks over 2500\&thinsp;m were seasonal except those on south-facing slopes. Additionally, we used SNODAS-derived estimates of solid and liquid precipitation, melt, sublimation, and blowing snow sublimation to define snow ephemerality mechanisms. In warm years, the Great Basin shifts to ephemerally dominant as the rain\textendash snow transition increases in elevation. Given that snow ephemerality is expected to increase as a consequence of climate change, physics-based modeling is needed that can account for the complex energetics of shallow snowpacks in complex terrain. These modeling efforts will need to be supported by field observations of mass and energy and linked to finer remote sensing snow products in order to track ephemeral snow dynamics.},

We investigated how historic snow patterns from a 32-year (1985\textendash 2016) snow reanalysis, which uses the timing and rate of remotely-sensed snow disappearance to reconstruct snow water equivalent in past years, could be used to improve current year simulations of snowfall in the Upper Tuolumne, Upper Kings, and Sagehen Creek watersheds in California's Sierra Nevada. Building on past research linking observations of fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) to spatial patterns of snow water equivalent, fSCA maps were used to identify pairs of dates from historic years in the reanalysis with similar snow accumulation and depletion patterns. Historic snow accumulation patterns were then used to extrapolate snow accumulation observed by snow pillows to 90 m snowfall fields. These 90 m snowfall fields were used as input for snow simulations, the accuracy of which were evaluated versus airborne lidar snow depth observations. Except for water-year 2015, which had record low snow in the Sierra Nevada and unique snow patterns, normalized snow accumulation and depletion patterns identified from historic dates with spatially correlated fSCA agreed with each other well, with mean absolute differences of approximately 10\%. Domain mean winter snowfall inferred from the relationship between historic snow accumulation patterns and current year snow pillow observations had a {$\pm$}13\% interquartile range of biases, relative to the snow reanalysis. Finally, snow depth simulations using snow pillow observed snowfall extrapolated with historic snow accumulation patterns had 70\% better coefficients of correlations, and 27\% better mean absolute errors, as compared to simulations using more common snowfall forcing. This work demonstrates the benefits of repeatable snowfall patterns and satellite-era snow reanalyses in mountainous regions with uncertain snowfall magnitude and spatial heterogeneity.},

This reduction has important social and economic implications, as water retained in the snowpack from winter storms forms an important part of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the region. A formal model-based detection and attribution (D\textendash A) study of these reductions is performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) to water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to reduce the effect of P variability on the results. Estimates of natural internal climate variability are obtained from 1600 years of two control simulations performed with fully coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and some aerosols are taken from multiple-member ensembles of perturbation experiments run with two models. The D\textendash A shows the observations and anthropogenically forced models have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained by natural internal climate variability alone. Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P reductions. The mean model estimate is that about half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols.},

Negative spatial covariances developed between maximum snow accumulation and ablation rate during early and middle melt, with the highest ablation rates occurring on slopes with the shallowest snowpacks. Atmospheric conditions were sufficiently well mixed across the valley that reference level air temperatures and humidity among the slopes were close to levels of measurement accuracy. However, under high levels of April insolation, notable differences in incoming solar radiation to varying slopes/aspects caused relatively larger differences in net radiation and surface temperature, which were progressively magnified as shrubs and soil became exposed during snow ablation. Under cloudier conditions later in melt, the south-facing snowpack had mostly ablated, vegetation was exposed at all sites, and ablation rates were virtually identical between the valley bottom and north-facing slope. Driven primarily by initial differences in insolation and snow accumulation, surface energy fluxes changed sign and magnitude over space, not only with insolation, vegetation cover, slope, and aspect, but also with the snow cover state and ground/vegetation exposure. Melt rate was, hence, controlled by both incoming energy and evolving and initial snow states. For these reasons, and because of the slope-based frame of reference necessary to precisely define the snowmelt energy balance, simple aggregate representations of melt in subarctic mountain environments that are based on averaged energy flux, snow state, and flat-plane conceptions may require substantive corrections that should be explored in modeling studies.},

  abstract = {Snow surface temperature (Ts) is important to the snowmelt energy balance and land-atmosphere interactions, but in situ measurements are rare, thus limiting evaluation of remote sensing data sets and distributed models. Here we test simple Ts approximations with standard height (2\textendash 4 m) air temperature (Ta), wet-bulb temperature (Tw), and dew point temperature (Td), which are more readily available than Ts. We used hourly measurements from seven sites to understand which Ts approximation is most robust and how Ts representation varies with climate, time of day, and atmospheric conditions (stability and radiation). Td approximated Ts with the lowest overall bias, ranging from -2.3 to +2.6\textdegree C across sites and from -2.8 to 1.5\textdegree C across the diurnal cycle. Prior studies have approximated Ts with Ta, which was the least robust predictor of Ts at all sites. Approximation of Ts with Td was most reliable at night, at sites with infrequent clear sky conditions, and at windier sites (i.e., more frequent turbulent instability). We illustrate how mean daily Td can help detect surface energy balance bias in a physically based snowmelt model. The results imply that spatial Td data sets may be useful for evaluating snow models and remote sensing products in data sparse regions, such as alpine, cold prairie, or Arctic regions. To realize this potential, more routine observations of humidity are needed. Improved understanding of Td variations will advance understanding of Ts in space and time, providing a simple yet robust measure of snow surface feedback to the atmosphere.},

Comparison of modeled and observed daily runoff data reveals that the regional model captures the present-day timing and trends of SDR. Results from an A2 scenario simulation indicate that increases in seasonal temperature of approximately 3\textdegree{} to 5\textdegree C resulting from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations could cause SDR to occur as much as two months earlier than present. These large changes result from an amplified snow-albedo feedback driven by the topographic complexity of the region, which is more accurately resolved in a high-resolution nested climate model. Earlier SDR could affect water storage in reservoirs and hydroelectric generation, with serious consequences for land use, agriculture, and water management in the American West.},

  abstract = {The small scale distribution of the snowpack in mountain areas is highly heterogeneous, and is mainly controlled by the interactions between the atmosphere and local topography. However, the influence of different terrain features in controlling variations in the snow distribution depends on the characteristics of the study area. As this leads to uncertainties in high spatial resolution snowpack simulations, a deeper understanding of the role of terrain features on the small scale distribution of snow depth is required. This study applied random forest algorithms to investigate the temporal evolution of snow depth in complex alpine terrain using as predictors various topographical variables and in situ snow depth observations at a single location. The high spatial resolution (1 m x 1 m) snow depth distribution database used in training and evaluating the random forests was derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) devices at three study sites, in the French Alps (2 sites) and the Spanish Pyrenees (1 site). The results show the major importance of two topographic variables, the topographic position index and the maximum upwind slope parameter. For these variables the search distances and directions depended on the characteristics of each site and the TLS acquisition date, but are consistent across sites and are tightly related to main wind directions. The weight of the different topographic variables on explaining snow distribution evolves while major snow accumulation events still take place and minor changes are observed after reaching the annual snow accumulation peak. Random forests have demonstrated good performance when predicting snow distribution for the sites included in the training set with R2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.94 and mean absolute errors always below 0.4 m. Oppositely, this algorithm failed when used to predict snow distribution for sites not included in the training set, with mean absolute errors above 0.8 m.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Forest cover modifies snow accumulation and ablation rates via canopy interception and changes in sub-canopy energy balance processes. However, the ways in which snowpacks are affected by forest canopy processes vary depending on climatic, topographic and forest characteristics. Here we present results from a~4-year study of snow\textendash forest interactions in the Oregon Cascades. We continuously monitored snow and meteorological variables at paired forested and open sites at three elevations representing the Low, Mid, and High seasonal snow zones in the study region. On a~monthly to bi-weekly basis, we surveyed snow depth and snow water equivalent across 900\,m transects connecting the forested and open pairs of sites. Our results show that relative to nearby open areas, the dense, relatively warm forests at Low and Mid sites impede snow accumulation via canopy snow interception and increase sub-canopy snowpack energy inputs via longwave radiation. Compared with the Forest sites, snowpacks are deeper and last longer in the Open site at the Low and Mid sites (4\textendash 26 and 11\textendash 33~days, respectively). However, we see the opposite relationship at the relatively colder High sites, with the Forest site maintaining snow longer into the spring by 15\textendash 29~days relative to the nearby Open site. Canopy interception efficiency (CIE) values at the Low and Mid Forest sites averaged 79 and 76\,\% of the total event snowfall, whereas CIE was 31\,\% at the lower density High Forest site. At all elevations, longwave radiation in forested environments appears to be the primary energy component due to the maritime climate and forest presence, accounting for 93, 92, and 47\,\% of total energy inputs to the snowpack at the Low, Mid, and High Forest sites, respectively. Higher wind speeds in the High Open site significantly increase turbulent energy exchanges and snow sublimation. Lower wind speeds in the High Forest site create preferential snowfall deposition. These results show the importance of understanding the effects of forest cover on sub-canopy snowpack evolution and highlight the need for improved forest cover model representation to accurately predict water resources in maritime forests.},

  abstract = {Snow disappearance date (SDD) affects the ecohydrological dynamics of montane forests, by altering water availability, forest fire regime, and the land surface energy budget. The forest canopy modulates SDD through competing processes; dense canopy intercepts snowfall and enhances longwave radiation while shading snowpack from shortwave radiation and sheltering it from the wind. Limited ground-based observations of snow presence and absence have restricted our ability to unravel the dominant processes affecting SDD in montane forests. We apply a lidar-derived method to estimate fractional snow cover area (fSCA) at two relatively warm sites in the Sierra Nevada and two colder sites in the Rocky Mountains, which we link to SDD. With the exception of late season snowpack and low fSCA, snow retention is longer under low vegetation density than under high vegetation density in both warm and cold sites. Warm forests consistently have longer snow retention in open areas compared to dense under canopy areas, particularly on south-facing slopes. Cold forests tend to have longer snow retention under lower density canopy compared to open areas, particularly on north-facing slopes. We use this empirical analysis to make process inferences and develop an initial framework to predict SDD that incorporates the role of topography and vegetation structure. Building on our framework will be necessary to provide better forest management recommendations for snowpack retention across complex terrain and heterogenous canopy structure.},

  abstract = {In the western United States, climate warming poses a unique threat to water and snow hydrology because much of the snowpack accumulates at temperatures near 0 \textdegree C. As the climate continues to warm, much of the region's precipitation is expected to switch from snow to rain, causing flashier hydrographs, earlier inflow to reservoirs, and reduced spring and summer snowpack. This study investigates historical variability in snow to precipitation proportion (Sf) and maps areas in the western United States that have demonstrated higher Sf sensitivity to warming in the past. Projected changes in Sf under 1.1, 1.8, and 3.0 \textdegree C future warming scenarios are presented in relation to historical variability and sensitivity. Our findings suggest that Sf in this region has primarily varied based on winter temperature rather than precipitation. The difference in Sf between cold and warm winters at low- and mid-elevations during 1916\textendash 2003 ranged from 31\% in the Pacific Northwest to 40\% in the California Sierra Nevada. In contrast, the difference in Sf between wet and dry winters was statistically not significant. Overall, in the northern Sierra, Klamath, and western slopes of the Cascade Mountains Ranges, Sf was most sensitive to temperature where winter temperature ranged between -5 to 5 \textdegree C. Results from our trend analysis show a regional shift in both Sf and signal-to-noise ratios during 1960\textendash 2003 as compared with 1916\textendash 2003. Our findings indicate that natural variability in Sf over 1916\textendash 2003 across all regions except for the Great Basin most closely resembles the projected 2040-warming scenario (+1.8 \textdegree C).},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt are important for estimating areal melt rates and snow-cover depletion (SCD) dynamics but are rarely measured in detail during the late ablation period. This study contributes results from high-resolution observations made using large numbers of sequential aerial photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle on an alpine ridge in the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory in the Canadian Rocky Mountains from May to July in 2015. Using structure-from-motion and thresholding techniques, spatial maps of snow depth, snow cover and differences in snow depth (dHS) during ablation were generated in very high resolution as proxies for spatial SWE, spatial ablation rates and SCD. The results indicate that the initial distribution of snow depth was highly variable due to overwinter snow redistribution; thus, the subsequent distribution of dHS was also variable due to albedo, slope/aspect and other unaccountable differences. However, the initial distribution of snow depth was 5 times more variable than that of the subsequent dHS values, which varied by a factor of 2 between the north and south aspects. dHS patterns were somewhat spatially persistent over time but had an insubstantial impact on SCD curves, which were overwhelmingly governed by the initial distribution of snow depth. The reason for this is that only a weak spatial correlation developed between the initial snow depth and dHS. Previous research has shown that spatial correlations between SWE and ablation rates can strongly influence SCD curves. Reasons for the lack of a correlation in this study area were analysed and a generalisation to other regions was discussed. The following questions were posed: what is needed for a large spatial correlation between initial snow depth and dHS? When should snow depth and dHS be taken into account to correctly model SCD? The findings of this study suggest that hydrological and atmospheric models need to incorporate realistic distributions of SWE, melt energy and cold content; therefore, they must account for realistic correlations (i.e. not too large or too small) between SWE and melt in order to accurately model SCD.},

In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from \textendash 1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients.},

  abstract = {Downwelling long-wave radiation is a crucial component of the energy balance of the land and ocean surface. Here we develop a semi-analytic model for the downwelling long-wave dependent on five governing parameters: the near-surface air temperature, the near-surface specific humidity, the surface air pressure, the e-folding height-scale of water vapour, and the CO2 concentration. The model predicts the hourly clear-sky long-wave in the ERA5 reanalysis product with a global mean error of 8.2 W{$\cdot$}m-2, and on average captures 97\% of the temporal variation at individual locations. We show that the model may be used to calculate clear-sky downwelling long-wave from only surface observations of temperature and humidity by using the time-mean water vapour height-scale from the ERA5, interpolated to the location of the observation. Using this method replicates sub-hourly observations from individual sites having a range of climates with errors of 12\textendash 25 W{$\cdot$}m-2. Furthermore, the inclusion of CO2 allows the model to be used to study changes in downwelling long-wave at the surface as CO2 concentrations vary. We validate the model's representation of CO2 by comparison with five CMIP5 climate models. Our model thus provides a simple yet accurate framework to understand the key parameters controlling downwelling long-wave and its variability in the current and future climates.},

These mountains receive precipitation overwhelmingly from wintertime storms including atmospheric rivers (ARs), much of it falling as snow at the higher elevations. Using a seven-decade record of daily observed temperature and precipitation as well as a snow reanalysis and downscaled climate projections, we documented historical and future changes in snow accumulation and snowlines. In four key subregions of California's snowy mountains, we quantified the progressing contribution of ARs and non-AR storms to the evolving and projected snow accumulation and snowlines (elevation of the snow-to-rain transition), exploring their climatology, variability and trends. Historically, snow makes up roughly a third of the precipitation affecting California's mountains. While ARs make up only a quarter of all precipitating days and, due to their relative warmth, produce snowlines higher than do other storms, they contribute over 40\% of the total seasonal snow. Under projected unabated warming, snow accumulation would decline to less than half of historical by the~late twenty-first century, with the greatest snow loss at mid elevations (from 1500 to 3300~m by the mountain sub-regions) during fall and spring. Central and Southern Sierra Nevada peaks above 3400~m might see occasionally extreme snow accumulations in January\textendash February resulting entirely from wetter ARs. AR-related snowlines are projected to increase by more than 700~m, compared to about 500~m for other storms. We discuss likely impacts of the changing climate for water resources as well as for winter recreation.},

In this Review, we examine the changes and trickle-d own impacts of snow loss in the western United States (WUS). Across the WUS, snow water equivalent declines of \textasciitilde 25\% are expected by 2050, with losses comparable with contemporary historical trends. There is less consensus on the time horizon of snow disappearance, but model projections combined with a new low-to-no snow definition suggest \textasciitilde 35\textendash 60 years before low-t o-no snow becomes persistent if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Diminished and more ephemeral snowpacks that melt earlier will alter groundwater and streamflow dynamics. The direction of these changes are difficult to constrain given competing factors such as higher evapotranspiration, altered vegetation co\- m\-pos\- i\-tion and changes in wildfire behaviour in a warmer world. These changes undermine conventional WUS water management practices, but through proactive implementation of soft and hard adaptation strategies, there is potential to build resilience to extreme, episodic and, eventually, persistent low-t o-no snow conditions. Federal investments offer a timely opportunity to address these vulnerabilities, but they require a concerted portfolio of activities that cross historically siloed physical and disciplinary boundaries.},

Here we show that this apparent insensitivity of snowpack to warming is a result of changes in the atmospheric circulation over the western United States, which have reduced snowpack losses due to warming. Climate model simulations indicate that the observed circulation changes have been driven in part by a shift in Pacific sea surface temperatures that is attributable to natural variability, and not part of the simulated response to anthropogenic forcing. Removing the influence of natural variability reveals a robust anthropogenic decline in western U.S. snowpack since the 1980s, particularly during the early months of the accumulation season (October\textendash November). These results suggest that the recent stability of western U.S. snowpack will be followed by a period of accelerated decline once the current mode of natural variability subsides.},

We examine trends in snow water equivalent (SWE) using passive microwave data (1987 to 2009). We find an overall decrease in SWE in HMA, despite regions of increased SWE in the Pamir, Kunlun Shan, Eastern Himalaya, and Eastern Tien Shan. Although the average decline in annual SWE across HMA (contributing area, 2641 \texttimes{} 10               3               km               2               ) is low (average, -0.3\%), annual SWE losses conceal distinct seasonal and spatial heterogeneities across the study region. For example, the Tien Shan has seen both strong increases in winter SWE and sharp declines in spring and summer SWE. In the majority of catchments, the most negative SWE trends are found in mid-elevation zones, which often correspond to the regions of highest snow-water storage and are somewhat distinct from glaciated areas. Negative changes in SWE storage in these mid-elevation zones have strong implications for downstream water availability.},

We introduce two new approaches to better understand how seasonal snow water storage during these two winters would compare to snow water storage under warmer climate conditions. The first approach calculates a spatial-probabilistic metric representing the likelihood that the snow water storage of 2013\textendash 2014 and 2014\textendash 2015 would occur under +2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C perturbed climate conditions. We computed snow water storage (basin-wide and across elevations) and the ratio of snow water equivalent to cumulative precipitation (across elevations) for the McKenzie River basin (3041 km2), a major tributary to the Willamette River in Oregon, USA. We applied these computations to calculate the occurrence probability for similarly low snow water storage under climate warming. Results suggest that, relative to +2 {$\smwhtcircle$}C conditions, basin-wide snow water storage during winter 2013\textendash 2014 would be above average, while that of winter 2014\textendash 2015 would be far below average. Snow water storage on 1 April corresponds to a 42 \% (2013\textendash 2014) and 92 \% (2014\textendash 2015) probability of being met or exceeded in any given year. The second approach introduces the concept of snow analogs to improve the anticipatory capacity of climate change impacts on snow-derived water resources. The use of a spatial-probabilistic approach and snow analogs provide new methods of assessing basin-wide snow water storage in a non-stationary climate and are readily applicable in other snow-dominated watersheds.},

SnowCloudHydro is a simple spreadsheet-based model that uses Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) output from SnowCloudMetrics as a key model input. In this application, SnowCloudMetrics rapidly converts NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover product (MOD10A1) into a monthly snow cover frequency for a user-specified watershed area. SnowCloudHydro uses SCF and prior monthly streamflow to forecast streamflow for the subsequent month. We tested the skill of SnowCloudHydro in three snow-dominated headwaters that represent a range of precipitation/snowmelt runoff categories: the R\'io Elqui in Northern Chile; the John Day River, in the Northwestern United States; and the R\'io Arag\'on in Northern Spain. The skill of the SnowCloudHydro model directly corresponded to snowpack contributions to streamflow. Watersheds with proportionately more snowmelt than rain provided better results (R2 values: 0.88, 0.52, and 0.22, respectively). To test the user experience of SnowCloud, we provided the tools and tutorials in English and Spanish to water resource managers in Chile, Spain, and the United States. Participants assessed their user experience, which was generally very positive. While these initial results focus on SnowCloud, they outline methods for developing cloud-based tools that can function effectively across cultures and languages. Our approach also addresses the primary challenges of science-based computing; human resource limitations, infrastructure costs, and expensive proprietary software. These challenges are particularly problematic in countries where scientific and computational resources are underdeveloped.},

Twenty years (1996\textendash 2015) of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-derived cloud cover indices (CC) with 4-km spatial and daily temporal resolutions are used as a proxy for cloudiness. The primary driver of nonseasonal fluctuations in daily mean solar insolation is the fluctuating cloudiness. We find that CC fluctuations are related to snowmelt and snow-fed streamflow fluctuations, to some extent (correlations of {$<$}0.5). Multivariate linear regression models of daily snowmelt (MELT) and streamflow ({$\Delta$}Q) variations are constructed for each month from February to July, when snowmelt is most active. Predictors include CC from five antecedent days up to the current day. The CC-MELT and CC-{$\Delta$}Q associations vary with time and location. The results show the dominance of negative correlations between CC and MELT, exemplifying the cloud-shading (or clear-sky) effect on snowmelt. The magnitude of the CC-MELT association (R2) amounts to 5\textendash 61\%, typically peaking in May. These associations fade earlier in summer during dry years than wet years, indicating the differing responses of thicker versus thinner snowpack. The CC-{$\Delta$}Q association displays a less consistent pattern, with R2 amounting to 2\textendash 47\%. Nevertheless, MELT and {$\Delta$}Q fluctuations exhibit spatially extensive patterns of correlations with daily cloudiness anomalies, indicating that the effects of cloudiness often operate over regional spatial scales.},

Smaller but statistically robust increases in dry extremes are also apparent. As a consequence, a 25\% to 100\% increase in extreme dry-to-wet precipitation events is projected, despite only modest changes in mean precipitation.

  abstract = {Forest responses to warming, in the absence of changes in vegetation structure, reflect the balance between the increased atmospheric demand for water and changes in water availability. This study uses a coupled hydroecologic model applied to a snow-dominated mountain watershed to demonstrate how complex topography and interannual variation in climate drivers combine to alter the balance between moisture availability and energy demand. We focus specifically on how often and under what conditions changes in the timing of soil water recharge as precipitation or snowmelt are a significant control on forest actual evapotranspiration (AET) in the Central California Sierra. We show that while interannual variation in precipitation is the dominant control on interannual variation in AET, how much of that recharge accumulates as a seasonal snowpack can act as a second-order control. This sensitivity of AET to snow accumulation and melt occurs across a substantial elevation range (1800\textendash 2700 m) and at both aggregate watershed and 90 m patch scales. Model results suggest that the variation in AET due to recharge timing is greatest for patches and years with moderate levels of precipitation or patches that receive substantial lateral moisture inputs. For a 3\textdegree C warming scenario, the annual AET increases in some years due to warmer temperatures but decreases by as much as 40\% in other years due to an earlier timing of snowmelt. These results help to clarify the conditions under which water availability for forests decreases and highlight scenarios that may lead to increased drought stress under a warming climate in snow-dominated mountain regions.},

Airborne lidar surveys used to estimate snow depth, topography, and vegetation were coupled with reanalysis climate products to quantify these interactions and to highlight potential snowpack sensitivities to climate and vegetation change across the western U.S. at Rocky Mountain (RM), Northern Basin and Range (NBR), and Sierra Nevada (SNV) sites. In forest and shrub areas, elevation captured the greatest amount of variability in snow depth (16\textendash 79\%) but aspect explained more variability (11\textendash 40\%) in alpine areas. Aspect was most important at RM sites where incoming shortwave to incoming net radiation (SW:NetR\#) was highest ( 0.5), capturing 17\textendash 37\% of snow depth variability in forests and 32\textendash 37\% in shrub areas. Forest vegetation height exhibited negative relationships with snow depth and explained 3\textendash 6\% of its variability at sites with greater longwave inputs (NBR and SNV). Variability in the importance of physiography suggests differential sensitivities of snowpack to climate and vegetation change. The high SW:NetR\# and importance of aspect suggests RM sites may be more responsive to decreases in SW:NetR\# driven by warming or increases in humidity or cloud cover. Reduced canopy-cover could increase snow depths at SNV sites, and NBR and SNV sites are currently more sensitive to shifts from snow to rain. The consistent importance of aspect and elevation indicates that changes in SW:NetR\# and the elevation of the rain/snow transition zone could have widespread and varied effects on western U.S. snowpacks.},

  abstract = {The common observation that snowpack increases with elevation suggests that a catchment's elevation distribution should be a robust indicator of its potential to store snow and its sensitivity to snowpack loss. To capture a wide range of potential elevation-based responses, we used Monte Carlo methods to simulate 20,000 watershed elevation distributions. We applied a simple function relating warming, elevation, and snowpack to explore snowpack losses from the simulated elevation distributions. Regression analyses demonstrate that snowpack loss is best described by three parameters that identify the central tendency, variance, and shape of each catchment's elevation distribution. Equal amounts of snowpack loss can occur even when catchments are centered within different elevation zones; this stresses the value of also measuring the variance and shape of elevation distributions. Responses of the simulated elevation distributions to warming are nonlinear and emphasize that the sensitivity of mountain forests to snowpack loss will likely be watershed dependent.},

Each data file is provided as a single year by variable and covers the same period of record as the Daymet V4 R1 daily data. The annual climatology files are derived from the larger datasets of daily weather parameters produced on a 1 km x 1 km grid for North America (including Canada, the United States, and Mexico), Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Separate annual files are provided for the land areas of continental North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.4), all 2020 and 2021 files (60 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs.

  abstract = {Snow accumulation and melt patterns play a significant role in the water, energy, carbon, and nutrient cycles in the montane environments of the Western United States. Recent studies have illustrated that changes in the snow/rainfall apportionments and snow accumulation and melt patterns may occur as a consequence of changes in climate in the region. In order to understand how these changes may affect the snow regimes of the region, the current characteristics of the snow accumulation and melt patterns must be identified. Here we characterize the snow water equivalent (SWE) curve formed by the daily SWE values at 766 snow pillow stations in the Western United States, focusing on several metrics of the yearly SWE curves and the relationships between the different metrics. The metrics are the initial snow accumulation and snow disappearance dates, the peak snow accumulation and date of peak, the length of the snow accumulation season, the length of the snowmelt season, and the snow accumulation and snowmelt slopes. Three snow regimes emerge from these results: a maritime, an intermountain, and a continental regime. The maritime regime is characterized by higher maximum snow accumulations reaching 300 cm and shorter accumulation periods of less than 220 days. Conversely, the continental regime is characterized by lower maximum accumulations below 200 cm and longer accumulation periods reaching over 260 days. The intermountain regime lies in between. The regions that show the characteristics of the maritime regime include the Cascade Mountains, the Klamath Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The intermountain regime includes the Eastern Cascades slopes and foothills, the Blue Mountains, Northern and Central basins and ranges, the Columbia Mountains/Northern Rockies, the Idaho Batholith, and the Canadian Rockies. Lastly, the continental regime includes the Middle and Southern Rockies, and the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains. The implications of snow regime classification are discussed in the context of possible changes in accumulation and melt patterns associated with regional warming.},

Previous studies have mainly focused on the null hypothesis of ``no trend'' or the ``Type I Error.'' However, few studies address the capability of the MK test to successfully recognize the trends. In some cases, especially when the trend test is jointly applied with hydropower station design, flood risk assessment, and water quality evaluation, the ``Type II error'' is equally important and should not be neglected. To cope with this problem, we carry out Monte Carlo simulations and the results indicate that in addition to the significance level and the sample length, the MK test power has a close relationship with the sample variance and the magnitude of the trend. For a given time series with fixed length, the power of the MK test increases as the slope increases and declines with increasing sample variance. A deterministic relationship between the slope and the standard deviation of the white noise that can be used for evaluating the power of the MK test has also been detected. Furthermore, we find that a positive autocorrelation contained in the time series will increase both the Type I and the Type II errors due to the enlargement of the variance in the MK statistics. Finally, we recommend that researchers slightly increase the significance level and lengthen the time series sample to improve the power of the MK test in future studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Small highly absorbing particles, present in concentrations of only 1 part per million by weight (ppmw) or less, can lower snow albedo in the visible by 5\textendash 15\% from the high values (96\textendash 99\%) predicted for pure snow in Part I. These particles have, however, no effect on snow albedo beyond 0.9 {$\mu$}m wavelength where ice itself becomes a strong absorber. Thus we have an attractive explanation for the discrepancy between theory and observation described in Part I, a discrepancy which seemingly cannot be resolved on the basis of near-field scattering and nonsphericity effects. Desert dust and carbon soot are the most likely contaminants. But careful measurements of spectral snow albedo in the Arctic and Antarctic paint to a ``grey'' absorber, one whose imaginary refractive index is nearly constant across the visible spectrum. Thus carbon soot, rather than the red iron oxide normally present in desert dust, is strongly indicated at these sites. Soot particles of radius 0.1 {$\mu$}m, in concentrations of only 0.3 ppmw, can explain the albedo measurements of Grenfell and Maykut on Arctic Ice Island T-3. This amount is consistent with some observations of soot in Arctic air masses. 1.5 ppmw of soot is required to explain the Antarctic observations of Kuhn and Siogas, which seemed an unrealistically large amount for the earth's most unpolluted continent until we learned that burning of camp heating fuel and aircraft exhaust indeed had contaminated the measurement site with soot. Midlatitude snowfields are likely to contain larger absolute amounts of soot and dust than their polar counterparts, but the snowfall is also much larger, so that the ppmw contamination does not differ drastically until melting begins. Nevertheless, the variations in absorbing particle concentration which will exist can help to explain the wide range of visible snow albedos reported in the literature. Longwave emissivity of snow is unaltered by its soot and dust content. Thus the depression of snow albedo in the visible is a systematic effect and always results in more energy being absorbed at a snow-covered surface than would be the case for pure snow. Thus man-made carbon soot aerosol may continue to exert a significant warming effect on the earth's climate even after it is removed from the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In many mountainous regions around the world, snow and soil moisture are key components of the hydrologic cycle. Preferential flow paths of snowmelt water through snow have been known to occur for years with few studies observing the effect on soil moisture. In this study, statistical analysis of the topographical and hydrological controls on the spatiotemporal variability of snow water equivalent (SWE) and soil moisture during snowmelt was undertaken at a~subalpine forested setting with north, south, and flat aspects as a~seasonally persistent snowpack melts. We investigated if evidence of preferential flow paths in snow can be observed and the effect on soil moisture through measurements of snow water equivalent and near-surface soil moisture, observing how SWE and near-surface soil moisture vary on hillslopes relative to the toes of hillslopes and flat areas. We then compared snowmelt infiltration beyond the near-surface soil between flat and sloping terrain during the entire snowmelt season using soil moisture sensor profiles. This study was conducted during varying snowmelt seasons representing above-normal, relatively normal, and below-normal snow seasons in northern Colorado. Evidence is presented of preferential meltwater flow paths at the snow\textendash soil interface on the north-facing slope causing increases in SWE downslope and less infiltration into the soil at 20\,cm depth; less association is observed in the near-surface soil moisture (top 7\,cm). We present a~conceptualization of the meltwater flow paths that develop based on slope aspect and soil properties. The resulting flow paths are shown to divert at least 4\,\% of snowmelt laterally, accumulating along the length of the slope, to increase the snow water equivalent by as much as 170\,\% at the base of a~north-facing hillslope. Results from this study show that snow acts as an extension of the vadose zone during spring snowmelt and future hydrologic investigations will benefit from studying the snow and soil together.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new model for calculating canopy shortwave radiation transmissivity from synthetic hemispheric images using only information contained within a canopy height model (CHM) \textendash{} CanopyHeightModel2Radiation (C2R). The enhanced version calculates synthetic hemispherical images based on the geometric arrangement of the surrounding canopy while applying a statistical correction for canopy transmissivity using canopy thickness and tree species leaf area. The simple input data and statistical correction make this model suitable for estimating canopy transmissivity across large spatial extents typical of land surface models for which canopy transmissivity or radiation is a primary input variable. Performance of C2R-enhanced is assessed against hemispherical photographs, and compared to a basic version of C2R without transmissivity correction, and two versions of a Lidar2Radiation model (L2R-enhanced, L2R-basic) with either a basic representation of canopy structure or an enhanced representation including trunks and branches within tree crowns. The two enhanced models (L2R-enhanced and C2R-enhanced) perform best compared to hemispherical photographs, while the L2R-basic and C2R-basic models over- and underestimate canopy transmissivity, respectively. At 1-meter and 10-minute resolution, the two enhanced models perform similarly, but exact timing and location of transmissivity controlled by canopy structure is better represented in the physically explicit L2R-enhanced model. Across hourly and 25~\texttimes ~25 m grid-averaged scales, both enhanced models achieve similar estimates of canopy transmissivity. Based on these results, it is recommended that the purely physically-based representation in the L2R-enhanced model is used when estimates of canopy transmissivity at high spatial and temporal (meter and minute) resolutions are necessary, while the computationally more efficient C2R-enhanced model is used when calculating canopy transmissivity within spatially aggregated grid cells, for example, as input into coarser-resolution land surface models. Incorporating C2R-enhanced into existing forest energy balance models creates exciting opportunities for investigating forest structure changes on forest hydrology and ecosystems across previously impossible spatial extents.},

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in investigating environmental, ecological processes and climate change at various scales, and is also valuable in the studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture conditions, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. These studies require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of TIR data, but rare of those can enhance both spatial and temporal details. This paper presents a new data fusion algorithm for producing Landsat-like LST data by blending daily MODIS and periodic Landsat TM datasets. The original Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was improved and modified for predicting thermal radiance and LST data by considering annual temperature cycle (ATC) and urban thermal landscape heterogeneity. The technique of linear spectral mixture analysis was employed to relate the Landsat radiance with the MODIS one, so that the temporal changes in radiance can be incorporated in the fusion model. This paper details the theoretical basis and the implementation procedures of the proposed data fusion algorithm, Spatio-temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Temperature mapping (SADFAT). A case study was conducted that predicted LSTs of five dates in 2005 from July to October in Los Angeles County, California. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 1.3 K to 2 K. Like existing spatio-temporal data fusion models, the SADFAT method has a limitation in predicting LST changes that were not recorded in the MODIS and/or Landsat pixels due to the model assumption. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The controls on the spatial distribution of soil moisture include static and dynamic variables. The superposition of static and dynamic controls can lead to different soil moisture patterns for a given catchment during wetting, draining, and drying periods. These relationships can be further complicated in snow-dominated mountain regions where soil water input by precipitation is largely dictated by the spatial variability of snow accumulation and melt. In this study, we assess controls on spatial and temporal soil moisture variability in a small (0.02 km2), snow-dominated, semi-arid catchment by evaluating spatial correlations between soil moisture and site characteristics through different hydrologic seasons. We assess the relative importance of snow with respect to other catchment properties on the spatial variability of soil moisture and track the temporal persistence of those controls. Spatial distribution of snow, distance from divide, soil texture, and soil depth exerted significant control on the spatial variability of moisture content throughout most of the hydrologic year. These relationships were strongest during the wettest period and degraded during the dry period. As the catchment cycled through wet and dry periods, the relative spatial variability of soil moisture tended to remain unchanged. We suggest that the static properties in complex terrain (slope, aspect, soils) impose first order controls on the spatial variability of snow and resulting soil moisture patterns, and that the interaction of dynamic (timing of water input) and static influences propagate that relative constant spatial variability through most of the hydrologic year. The results demonstrate that snow exerts significant influence on how water is retained within mid-elevation semi-arid catchments and suggest that reductions in annual snowpacks associated with changing climate regimes may strongly influence spatial and temporal soil moisture patterns and catchment physical and biological processes.},

  abstract = {California's water resources rely heavily on cool-season (November\textendash March) precipitation in the Sierra Nevada. Interannual variability is highly volatile and seasonal forecasting has little to no skill, making water management particularly challenging. Over 1902\textendash 2020, Sierra Nevada cool-season precipitation totals exhibited significant 2.2- and 13\textendash 15-year cycles, accounting for approximately 40\% of total variability and perhaps signifying potential as seasonal forecasting tools. However, the underlying climate dynamics are not well understood and it is unclear whether these cycles are stable over the long term. We use tree rings to reconstruct Sierra Nevada cool-season precipitation back to 1400. The reconstruction is skillful, accounting for 55\%\textendash 74\% of observed variability and capturing the 20th-century 2.2- and 13\textendash 15-year cycles. Prior to 1900, the reconstruction indicates no other century-long periods of significant spectral power in the 2.2- or 13\textendash 15-year bands. The reconstruction does indicate significant cyclicity over other extended periods of several decades or longer, however, with dominant periodicities in the ranges of 2.1\textendash 2.7 and 3.5\textendash 8 years. The late 1700s through 1800s exhibited the highest-amplitude cycles in the reconstruction, with periodicities of 2.4 and 5.7\textendash 7.4 years. The reconstruction should serve to caution against extrapolating the observed 2.2- and 13\textendash 15-year cycles to guide future expectations. On the other hand, observations and the reconstruction suggest that interannual variability of Sierra Nevada cool-season precipitation is not a purely white noise process and research should aim to diagnose the dynamical drivers of extended periods of cyclicity in this critical natural resource.},

  abstract = {Abstract Wind is widely recognized as one of the dominant controls of snow accumulation and distribution in exposed alpine regions. Complex and highly variable wind fields in rugged terrain lead to similarly complex snow distribution fields with areas of no snow adjacent to areas of deep accumulation. Unfortunately, these complexities have limited inclusion of wind redistribution effects in spatial snow distribution models. In this study the difficulties associated with physically exhaustive wind field modeling are avoided and terrain-based parameters are developed to characterize wind effects. One parameter, , was based on maximum upwind slopes relative to seasonally averaged winds to characterize the wind scalar at each pixel location in an alpine basin. A second parameter, , measured upwind breaks in slope from a given location and was combined with an upwind application of to create a drift delineator parameter, D0, which was used to delineate sites of intense redeposition on lee slopes. Based on 504 snow depth samples from a May 1999 survey of the upper Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, the correlation of the developed parameters to the observed snow distribution and the effect of their inclusion in a spatial snow distribution model were quantified. The parameter was found to be a significant predictor, accounting for more of the variance in the observed snow depth than could be explained by elevation, solar radiation, or slope. Samples located in D0-delineated drift zones were shown to have significantly greater depths than samples located in nondrift zones. A regression tree model of snow distribution based on a predictor variable set of , D0, elevation, solar radiation, and slope explained 8\%\textendash 23\% more variance in the observed snow distribution, and performed noticeably better in unsampled areas of the basin, compared to a regression tree model based on only the latter three predictors.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a method for calculating the spectral albedo of snow which can be used at any wavelength in the solar spectrum and which accounts for diffusely or directly incident radiation at any zenith angle. For deep snow, the model contains only one adjustable parameter, an effective grain size, which is close to observed grain sizes. A second parameter, the liquid-equivalent depth, is required only for relatively thin snow. In order for the model to make realistic predictions, it must account for the extreme anisotropy of scattering by snow particles. This is done by using the ``delta-Eddington'' approximation for multiple scattering, together with Mie theory for single scattering. The spectral albedo from 0.3 to 5 {$\mu$}m wavelength is examined as a function of the effective grain size, the solar zenith angle, the snowpack thickness, and the ratio of diffuse to direct solar incidence. The decrease in albedo due to snow aging can be mimicked by reasonable increases in grain size (50\textendash 100 {$\mu$}m for new snow, growing to 1 mm for melting old snow). The model agrees well with observations for wavelengths above 0.8 {$\mu$}m. In the visible and near-UV, on the other hand, the model may predict albedos up to 15\% higher than those which are actually observed. Increased grain size alone cannot lower the model albedo sufficiently to match these observations. It is also argued that the two major effects which are neglected in the model, namely nonsphericity of snow grains and near-field scattering, cannot be responsible for the discrepancy. Insufficient snow depth and error in measured absorption coefficient are also ruled out as the explanation. The remaining hypothesis is that visible snow albedo is reduced by trace amounts of absorptive impurities (Warren and Wiscombe, 1980, Part II).},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of snow in global water and energy budgets, estimates of global mountain snow water equivalent (SWE) are not well constrained. Two approaches for estimating total range-wide SWE over Sierra Nevada, California, are assessed: 1) global/hemispherical models and remote sensing and models available for continental United States (CONUS) plus southern Canada (CONUS1) available to the scientific community and 2) regional climate model simulations via the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model run at 3, 9, and 27 km. As no truth dataset provides total mountain range SWE, these two approaches are compared to a ``reference'' SWE consisting of three published, independent datasets that utilize/validate against in situ SWE measurements. Model outputs are compared with the reference datasets for three water years: 2005 (high snow accumulation), 2009 (average), and 2014 (low). There is a distinctive difference between the reference/WRF datasets and the global/CONUS1 daily estimates of SWE, with the former suggesting up to an order of magnitude more snow. Results are qualitatively similar for peak SWE and 1 April SWE for all three years. Analysis of SWE time series indicates that lower SWE for global and CONUS1 datasets is likely due to precipitation, rain/snow partitioning, and ablation parameterization differences. It is found that WRF produces reasonable (within 50\%) estimates of total mountain range SWE in the Sierra Nevada, while the global and CONUS1 datasets underestimate SWE.},

  abstract = {The ``dry gets drier, and wet gets wetter'' (DDWW) paradigm has been widely used to summarize the expected trends of the global hydrologic cycle under climate change. However, the paradigm is largely conditioned by choice of different metrics and datasets used and is still comprehensively unexplored from the perspective of terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSAs). Considering the essential role of TWSAs in wetting and drying of the land system, here we built upon a large ensemble of TWSA datasets, including satellite-based products, global hydrological models, land surface models, and global climate models to evaluate the DDWW hypothesis during the historical (1985\textendash 2014) and future (2071\textendash 2100) periods under various scenarios with a 0.05 significance level (for trend estimates). We find that 11.01 \%\textendash 40.84 \% (range by various datasets) of global land confirms the DDWW paradigm, while 10.21 \%\textendash 35.43 \% of the area shows the opposite pattern during the historical period. In the future, the DDWW paradigm is still challenged, with the percentage supporting the pattern lower than 18 \% and both the DDWW-validated and DDWW-opposed proportion increasing along with the intensification of emission scenarios. We show that the different choices of data sources can reasonably influence the test results up to a 4-fold difference. Our findings will provide insights and implications for global wetting and drying trends from the perspective of TWSA under climate change.},

  abstract = {Whereas many independent methods are used to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) and its spatial distribution and seasonal variability, a need exists for a systematic characterization of inter-model differences at annual, seasonal, and regional scales necessary to quantify the associated uncertainty in these datasets. This study conducts a multi-scale validation and comparison, based on Airborne Snow Observatory data, of five state-of-the-art SWE datasets in the Sierra Nevada, California, including three SWE datasets from retrospective models: an INiTial REConstruction model (REC-INT), an improved REConstruction model based on the ParBal energy balance model (REC-ParBal), and a Sierra Nevada SWE REConstruction with Data Assimilation (REC-DA), and two operational SWE datasets from the U.S. National Weather Service, including the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) and the National Water Model (NWM-SWE). The results show that REC-DA and REC-ParBal provide the two most accurate estimates of SWE in the snowmelt season, both with small positive biases. REC-DA provides the most accurate spatial distribution of SWE (R2 = 0.87, MAE = 66~mm, PBIAS = 8.3\%) at the pixel scale, while REC-ParBal has the least basin-wide PBIAS (R2 = 0.79, MAE = 73~mm, PBIAS = 4.1\%) in the snowmelt season. Moreover, REC-DA underestimates peak SWE by -5.8\%, while REC-ParBal overestimates it by 7.5\%, when compared with the measured peak SWE at snow pillow stations across the Sierra Nevada. The two operational SWE products\textemdash SNODAS and NWM-SWE\textemdash are less accurate. Furthermore, the inter-model comparison reveals a certain amount of disagreement in snow water storage across time and space between SWE datasets. This study advances our understanding of regional SWE uncertainties and provides critical insights to support future applications of these SWE data products and therefore has broad implications for water resources management and hydrological process studies.},

However, the power of these tests has not been well documented. This study investigates the power of the tests by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results indicate that their power depends on the pre-assigned significance level, magnitude of trend, sample size, and the amount of variation within a time series. That is, the bigger the absolute magnitude of trend, the more powerful are the tests; as the sample size increases, the tests become more powerful; and as the amount of variation increases within a time series, the power of the tests decrease. When a trend is present, the power is also dependent on the distribution type and skewness of the time series. The simulation results also demonstrate that these two tests have similar power in detecting a trend, to the point of being indistinguishable in practice. The two tests are implemented to assess the significance of trends in annual maximum daily streamflow data of 20 pristine basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that the P-values computed by these different tests are almost identical. By the binomial distribution, the field significant downward trend was assessed at the significance level of 0.05. Results indicate that a higher number of sites show evidence of decreasing trends than one might expect due to chance alone.},
