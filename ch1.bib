  abstract = {In the mountains, snowmelt often provides most of the runoff. Operational estimates use imagery from optical and passive microwave sensors, but each has its limitations. An accurate approach, which we validate in Afghanistan and the Sierra Nevada USA, reconstructs spatially distributed snow water equivalent (SWE) by calculating snowmelt backward from a remotely sensed date of disappearance. However, reconstructed SWE estimates are available only retrospectively; they do not provide a forecast. To estimate SWE throughout the snowmelt season, we consider physiographic and remotely sensed information as predictors and reconstructed SWE as the target. The period of analysis matches the AMSR-E radiometer's lifetime from 2003 to 2011, for the months of April through June. The spatial resolution of the predictions is 3.125 km, to match the resolution of a microwave brightness temperature product. Two machine learning techniques \textendash{} bagged regression trees and feed-forward neural networks \textendash{} produced similar mean results, with 0\textendash 14 \% bias and 46\textendash 48 mm RMSE on average. Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiencies averaged 0.68 for all years. Daily SWE climatology and fractional snow-covered area are the most important predictors. We conclude that these methods can accurately estimate SWE during the snow season in remote mountains, and thereby provide an independent estimate to forecast runoff and validate other methods to assess the snow resource.},

  abstract = {Time series of snow covered area (SCA) estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were merged with a spatially explicit snowmelt model to reconstruct snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Rio Grande headwaters (3419 km2). A linear optimization scheme was used to derive SCA estimates that preserve the statistical moments of the higher spatial resolution (i.e. 30 m) ETM+ data and resolve the superior temporal signal (i.e. {$\sim$} daily) of the MODIS data. It was found that merging the two SCA products led to an 8\% decrease and an 18\% increase in the basinwide SWE in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared to the SWE estimated from ETM+ only. Relative to SWE simulations using only ETM+ data, the hybrid SCA estimates reduced the mean absolute SWE error by 17 and 84\% in 2001 and 2002, respectively; errors were determined using intensive snow survey data and two separate methods of scaling snow survey field measurements of SWE to the 1-km model pixel resolution. SWE bias for both years was reduced by 49\% and skewness was reduced from -0.78 to 0.49. These results indicate that the hybrid SWE was closer to being an unbiased estimate of the measured SWE and errors were distributed more normally. The accuracy of the SCA estimates is likely dependent on the vegetation fraction.},

  abstract = {Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins, and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Another method is repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) that allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence, and (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeat-pass InSAR-based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of \&lt; 1 km without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz) spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas, thus providing complementary coverage to passive-microwave-based SWE estimation. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems.},

  abstract = {This paper used a data assimilation framework to estimate spatially and temporally continuous snow water equivalent (SWE) from a 27 year reanalysis (from water year 1985 to 2011) of the Landsat-5 record for the Kern River watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California. The data assimilation approach explicitly treats sources of uncertainty from model parameters, meteorological inputs, and observations. The method is comprised of two main components: (1) a coupled land surface model (LSM) and snow depletion curve (SDC) model, which is used to generate an ensemble of predictions of SWE and fractional snow cover area (FSCA) for a given set of prior (uncertain) inputs, and (2) a retrospective reanalysis step, which updates estimation variables to be consistent with the observed fractional snow cover time series. The final posterior SWE estimate is generated from the LSM-SDC using the posterior estimation variables consistently with all postulated sources of uncertainty in the model, inputs, and observations. A reasonable agreement was found between the SWE reanalysis and in situ SWE observations and streamflow data. The data set was studied to evaluate factors controlling SWE spatial and temporal variability. Elevation was found to be the primary control on spatial patterns of peak-SWE and day-of-peak. The easting coordinate had additional explanatory power, which is hypothesized to be related to rain shadow effects due to the prevailing storm track directions. The spatial patterns were found to be interannually inconsistent. However, drier years and lower elevations were found more variable than wetter years and higher elevations, respectively. Only a very small percentage of the Kern River watershed had a significant trend in peak-SWE and day-of-peak. Trends deemed to be significant were found to be positive (peak-SWE is increasing and day-of-peak occurs later) at higher elevations, but negative (peak-SWE is decreasing and day-of-peak occurs earlier) at lower elevations. The reanalysis approach proved to be useful in terms of identifying subwatershed variability and trends, and could be extended to larger regions and areas where in situ data are sparse or unavailable.},

  abstract = {Snow accumulation and melt is highly variable in space and time in complex mountainous environments. Therefore, it is necessary to provide high-resolution spatially and temporally distributed estimates of sub-basin snow water equivalent (SWE) to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. In this study, we compare two reconstruction techniques (a commonly used deterministic reconstruction vs a probabilistic data assimilation framework). The methods retrospectively estimate SWE from a time series of remotely sensed maps of fractional snow-covered area (FSCA). In testing both methods over the Tokopah watershed in the Sierra Nevada (California), the probabilistic reconstruction approach is shown to be a more robust generalization of the deterministic reconstruction. Under idealized conditions, both probabilistic and deterministic approaches perform reasonably well and yield similar results when compared with in situ verification data, whereas the probabilistic reconstruction was found to be in slightly better agreement with snow-pit observations. More importantly, the probabilistic approach was found to be more robust: unaccounted for biases in solar radiation impacted the probabilistic SWE estimates less than the deterministic case (4\% vs 7\% errors for water year (WY)1997 and 0\% vs 3\% errors for WY1999); the probabilistic reconstruction was found to be less sensitive to the number of available observations (6\% vs 10\% errors in WY1997 and 13\% vs 44\% errors in WY1999 from the nominal cases when four fewer FSCA images were available). Finally, results from the probabilistic reconstruction approach, which requires precipitation inputs (unlike the deterministic approach), were found to be relatively robust to bias in prior precipitation estimates, where the nominal case mean estimates were recovered even when an underestimated prior precipitation was used. The additional robustness of the probabilistic SWE reconstruction technique should prove useful in future applications over larger basins and longer periods in mountainous terrain.

The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.},

They are highly sensitive and prone to climate change3,4, yet their importance and vulnerability have not been quantified at the global scale. Here we present a global water tower index (WTI), which ranks all water towers in terms of their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems and society. For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas. Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world's most important and vulnerable water towers.},

Active and passive microwave remote sensing methods are explored, as local methods cannot be generalized due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the snow pack.

For dry snow of a few meters depth and frequencies below 20 GHz, absorption and scattering in the snow volume are negligible compared with the backscattered energy from the underlying ground. The signal delay caused by refraction can be measured with differential radar interferometry, but phase wrapping errors and temporal decorrelation must be considered. We demonstrate that large {$\Delta$}SWE can be accurately determined from dense time series of differential interferograms at X- and Ku-band by temporal integration. Lost phase cycles are reconstructed with a two-frequency approach. Temporal decorrelation is minimized by a temporal resolution of 4 h. A linear function between {$\Delta$}SWE and phase difference is derived, which deviates only a few percent from the exact solution and which depends negligibly on snow density and stratigraphy. {$\Delta$}SWE retrieved from observations of the SnowScat instrument (SSI) were validated against observed SWE from different reference instruments, installed at a test site near the town of Sodankyl\"a, Finland. An accuracy below {$\pm$}6 mm SWE was achieved at frequencies of 10 and 16 GHz for up to 200 mm of {$\Delta$}SWE. An exceptionally high temporal coherence was observed for up to 30 days for dry snow, whereas for wet snow it decayed within hours.},

  abstract = {The first issue of WRR appeared eight years after the launch of Sputnik, but by WRR's 25th anniversary, only seven papers that used remote sensing had appeared. Over the journal's second 25 years, that changed remarkably, and remote sensing is now widely used in hydrology and other geophysical sciences. We attribute this evolution to production of data sets that scientists not well versed in remote sensing can use, and to educational initiatives like NASA's Earth System Science Fellowship program that has supported over a thousand scientists, many in hydrology. We review progress in remote sensing in hydrology from a water balance perspective. We argue that progress is primarily attributable to a creative use of existing and past satellite sensors to estimate such variables as evapotranspiration rates or water storage in lakes and reservoirs and to new and planned missions. Recent transforming technologies include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and U.S. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Future missions include Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) to measure river discharge and lake, reservoir, and wetland storage. Measurement of some important hydrologic variables remains problematic: retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) from space remains elusive especially in mountain areas, even though snow cover extent is well observed, and was the topic of 4 of the first 5 remote sensing papers published in WRR. We argue that this area deserves more strategic thinking from the hydrology community.},

  abstract = {In the western United States, the seasonal phase of snow storage bridges between winter-dominant precipitation and summer-dominant water demand. The critical role of snow in water supply has been frequently quantified using the ratio of snowmelt-derived runoff to total runoff. However, current estimates of the fraction of annual runoff generated by snowmelt are not based on systematic analyses. Here based on hydrological model simulations and a new snowmelt tracking algorithm, we show that 53\% of the total runoff in the western United States originates as snowmelt, despite only 37\% of the precipitation falling as snow. In mountainous areas, snowmelt is responsible for 70\% of the total runoff. By 2100, the contribution of snowmelt to runoff will decrease by one third for the western U.S. in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Snowmelt-derived runoff currently makes up two thirds of the inflow to the region's major reservoirs. We argue that substantial impacts on water supply are likely in a warmer climate.},

The method (fully Bayesian), resolution (daily and 90 m), temporal extent (31 years), and accuracy provide a unique dataset for investigating snow processes. The verified dataset (based on a comparison with over 9000 station years of in situ data) exhibited mean and rootmean-square errors less than 3 and 13 cm, respectively, and correlation greater than 0.95 compared with in situ SWE observations. The reanalysis dataset was used to characterize the peak SWE climatology to provide a basic accounting of the stored snowpack water in the Sierra Nevada over the last 31 years. The pixel-wise peak SWE volume over the domain was found to be 20.0 km3 on average with a range of 4.0\textendash 40.6 km3. The ongoing drought in California contains the two lowest snowpack years (water years 2014 and 2015) and three of the four driest years over the examined record. It was found that the basin-average peak SWE, while underestimating the total water storage in snowpack over the year, accurately captures the interannual variability in stored snowpack water. However, the results showed that the assumption that 1 April SWE is representative of the peak SWE can lead to significant underestimation of basin-average peak SWE both on an average (21\% across all basins) and on an interannual basis (up to 98\% across all basin years).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a newly proposed data assimilation method for historical snow water equivalent SWE estimation using remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area fSCA. The newly proposed approach consists of a particle batch smoother (PBS), which is compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27-yr Landsat 5 record at snow pillow and snow course in situ verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates, with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The prior RMSE values at the snow pillow and snow course sites were reduced by 68\%\textendash 82\% and 60\%\textendash 68\%, respectively, when applying the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBS RMSE was ;54\% of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the PBS RMSE was ;79\% of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS to the mean prior precipitation input, especially in the case where significant prior biases exist.},

In this reconstruction approach, modeled snowmelt over each pixel is integrated during the period of satellite-observed snow cover to estimate SWE. Due to underestimates in snow cover detection, maximum basin-wide mean SWE using MODIS and AVHRR were, respectively, 45\% and 68\% lower than SWE estimates obtained using ETM+ data. The mean absolute error (MAE) of SWE estimated at 100-m resolution using ETM+ data was 23\% relative to observed SWE from intensive field campaigns. Model performance deteriorated when MODIS (MAE = 50\%) and AVHRR (MAE = 89\%) SCA data were used. Relative to differences in the SCA products, model output was less sensitive to spatial resolution (MAE = 39\% and 73\% for ETM+ and MODIS simulations run at 1 km resolution, respectively), indicating that SWE reconstructions at the scale of MODIS acquisitions may be tractable provided the SCA product is improved. When considering tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors, our results indicate that higher spatial resolution products such as ETM+ remain more accurate despite the lower frequency of acquisition. This motivates continued efforts to improve MODIS snow cover products.},

SWE maps, deduced from the observed change of the RP-InSAR phase delay in the snowpack, show good agreement with field measurements.

However, little guidance exists as to which configuration is preferable. Because the two approaches theoretically have opposite sensitivities to model forcing, combining (averaging) their SWE estimates may be advantageous. Using 154 snow pillow sites located in maritime mountains of the western United States, we compared forward, reconstruction, and combined configurations of a simplified SNOW-17. We evaluated model errors in annual precipitation, peak SWE, and SWE errors during the accumulation and ablation seasons. We also conducted a separate analysis to assess the sensitivity of peak SWE to biased forcing data and model parameters. The forward model had the greatest precipitation accuracy, while the combined model had the greatest accuracy in peak SWE and SWE during the accumulation and ablation seasons. In determining peak SWE, the forward and reconstruction models demonstrated opposite sensitivities to errors in air temperature and model parameters, and the combined model minimized errors due to temperature bias and parameter uncertainty. In basins with precipitation gages, we recommend PRISM for precipitation estimation and the combined model for SWE estimation. In areas with high precipitation uncertainty, reconstruction is more viable. Accurate model parameters dramatically improved reconstruction, so more work is needed to advance parameter estimation techniques in complex terrain.},

Due to refraction, the interferometric phase changes with snow depth and density, which is exploited by the InSAR method. While the method was first proposed two decades ago, qualitative research using experimental data analyzing factors affecting retrieval performance remains scarce. In this work a tower-based 1-10 GHz, fully polarimetric SAR with InSAR capabilities was used to analyze the effect of meteorological events (air temperature, precipitation intensity, and wind) on the observed temporal decorrelation of interferometric image pairs, at L-, S-, C- and X-bands. These factors were found to be causes of decorrelation in snow, being the temperature the critical variable in the case of snowmelt events. Of the analyzed bands, L-band presented the best coherence conservation properties. Additionally, the phase change between pairs with sufficient coherence was applied to generate estimates of changes in SWE, studying the retrieval errors at different bands and over different temporal baselines. SWE accumulation was calculated from 6 hours up to 12 days temporal baseline over a non-vegetated area. SWE accumulation profiles were successfully reconstructed for short temporal baselines and low frequencies, while an increase in the retrieval error was observed for high frequencies and long temporal baselines, indicating the limitations of higher frequencies for repeat-pass InSAR retrieval. The analysis was also reproduced over a forested area at L-band with similar results as to the non-vegetated area.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is decreasing seasonal snowpacks globally, with potentially catastrophic consequences on water resources, given the long-h eld reliance on snowpack in water management. In this Review, we examine the changes and trickle-d own impacts of snow loss in the western United States (WUS). Across the WUS, snow water equivalent declines of \textasciitilde 25\% are expected by 2050, with losses comparable with contemporary historical trends. There is less consensus on the time horizon of snow disappearance, but model projections combined with a new low-to-no snow definition suggest \textasciitilde 35\textendash 60 years before low-t o-no snow becomes persistent if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Diminished and more ephemeral snowpacks that melt earlier will alter groundwater and streamflow dynamics. The direction of these changes are difficult to constrain given competing factors such as higher evapotranspiration, altered vegetation co\- m\-pos\- i\-tion and changes in wildfire behaviour in a warmer world. These changes undermine conventional WUS water management practices, but through proactive implementation of soft and hard adaptation strategies, there is potential to build resilience to extreme, episodic and, eventually, persistent low-t o-no snow conditions. Federal investments offer a timely opportunity to address these vulnerabilities, but they require a concerted portfolio of activities that cross historically siloed physical and disciplinary boundaries.},

  abstract = {Whereas many independent methods are used to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) and its spatial distribution and seasonal variability, a need exists for a systematic characterization of inter-model differences at annual, seasonal, and regional scales necessary to quantify the associated uncertainty in these datasets. This study conducts a multi-scale validation and comparison, based on Airborne Snow Observatory data, of five state-of-the-art SWE datasets in the Sierra Nevada, California, including three SWE datasets from retrospective models: an INiTial REConstruction model (REC-INT), an improved REConstruction model based on the ParBal energy balance model (REC-ParBal), and a Sierra Nevada SWE REConstruction with Data Assimilation (REC-DA), and two operational SWE datasets from the U.S. National Weather Service, including the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) and the National Water Model (NWM-SWE). The results show that REC-DA and REC-ParBal provide the two most accurate estimates of SWE in the snowmelt season, both with small positive biases. REC-DA provides the most accurate spatial distribution of SWE (R2 = 0.87, MAE = 66~mm, PBIAS = 8.3\%) at the pixel scale, while REC-ParBal has the least basin-wide PBIAS (R2 = 0.79, MAE = 73~mm, PBIAS = 4.1\%) in the snowmelt season. Moreover, REC-DA underestimates peak SWE by -5.8\%, while REC-ParBal overestimates it by 7.5\%, when compared with the measured peak SWE at snow pillow stations across the Sierra Nevada. The two operational SWE products\textemdash SNODAS and NWM-SWE\textemdash are less accurate. Furthermore, the inter-model comparison reveals a certain amount of disagreement in snow water storage across time and space between SWE datasets. This study advances our understanding of regional SWE uncertainties and provides critical insights to support future applications of these SWE data products and therefore has broad implications for water resources management and hydrological process studies.},

  abstract = {We present a conceptual model for the ecology of the spring snowmelt recession based on the natural flow regime that relates the quantifiable components of magnitude, timing, and rate of change to abiotic and biotic factors that govern riverine processes. We find that shifts in the magnitude of the recession largely affect abiotic channel conditions, whereas shifts in the timing of the snowmelt primarily affect biotic conditions. Shifts in the rate of change affect both abiotic and biotic conditions, creating the largest observed changes to the stream ecosystem. We discuss these components with regard to the success of riverine species in California's Mediterranean-montane environment. We then present two scenarios of change to the spring snowmelt recession\textemdash effects of flow regulation and climate warming\textemdash and discuss their potential implications for riverine ecology. Our conceptual model can help guide watershed stakeholders toward a better understanding of the impacts of changing spring recession conditions on stream ecosystems.},
