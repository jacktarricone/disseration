Seasonal snowmelt from midlatituide mountain environments is the main source of water for nearly a billion people across the globe \citep{sturmWaterLifeSnow2017}.
Climate warming is affecting the stationarity of various hydroclimatic processes \citep{millyStationarityDeadWhither2008}. In Western US (WUS), this means warmer winter temperatures \cite{gergelEffectsClimateChange2017}, more cold season precipitation falling as rain \citep{knowlesTrendsSnowfallRainfall2006}, which in turn impact snow accumulation and ablation processes \citep{kapnickCausesRecentChanges2012}. These snowpack variations influence streamflow timing \citep{stewartChangesSnowmeltRunoff2004} and effect the magnitude of streamflow overall \citep{barnhartSnowmeltRateDictates2016}. (***rework). These variations have significant implications for water resource manaement in an uncerainty future \citep{livnehDroughtLessPredictable2020}.

% importance and emerge of mind 
Gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying the fluctuations in the mountain snowpack during the holds crucial significance in comprehending forthcoming alterations. Common snow metrics like April 1st snow water equivalent (SWE) and maximum SWE (MSWE) are used to estimate spring flows. Yet, with the recent climate warming midwinter melt has becoming of interest, as it is becoming more common with dry spells, and this melt impacts max SWE and melt season processes. Understanding 




Physiographic parameters, i.e. elevation, aspect, slope, are first order controls of fluxes of water, energy, and nutrients through the environment  \citep{pelletierWhichWayYou2018a}. Aspect, or slope orientation, serves as a primary control on hydrologic, ecologic, and geomporphic processes, as is moderates the magnitude and directness of the incoming solar radiation (herein insolation) \citep{broxtonRoleAspectQuantify2009}. This process is magnified in midlatitude mountain environments, where the lower sun angle creates a greater disparity energy inputs on the slopes. Incoming solar radiation is the primary driver of snowmelt in the ablation season (marks and dozier). 


These factors then play a significant roll in acuumulatoin and distrubtion of snowpack across the landscape.

%%%% BROXTON TEXT
%*********At a specific location with uniform geology and climate, the aspect of the land surface will exert a strong control over the amount of received energy, and potentially will influence hydrologic response. The link between aspect and hydrology is straightforward. Aspect (along with other factors that influence the local energy budget, such as the latitude of the study site, the ratio between direct and diffuse solar radiation, prevailing winds, and shading due to distant topography) is related to the amount of incoming solar energy that a particular hillslope receives. This is especially true in the midlatitudes and high latitudes, as the sun is lower on the horizon, which results in a greater contrast between the energy inputs of north and south facing slopes.*******


 
% Warming temperatures have affected both the accumulation (cite) and ablation (cite) of mountain snowpack, which in turn. The Sierra Nevada is especially susceptible to these changes because its location is in the midlatitudes, where many of the catchments are low to mid-altitude basins, and small increases in temperature could push temperatures above 0 °C ore frequently \cite{gergelEffectsClimateChange2017}. These warming temperatures will affect both precipitation phase partitioning from snow to rain \citep{knowlesTrendsSnowfallRainfall2006}, which will decrease both snowfall amounts and snowpack cold content \citep{harpoldChangesSnowpackAccumulation2012a}. \cite{nolinMappingRiskSnow2006} characterized this type of snow as "at-risk" or snow with the highest potential of being affected by warming temperatures. 

%% paragraph on midwinter ablation

%% gaps we're addressing re: pillows and big modles
Past studies have leveraged in situ data \citep{clowChangesTimingSnowmelt2010,harpoldChangesSnowpackAccumulation2012a,kapnickCausesRecentChanges2012,musselmanWinterMeltTrends2021} and kilometer-scale models to evaluate various monotonic snowpack metric trends 
\citep{moteDECLININGMOUNTAINSNOWPACK2005, moteDramaticDeclinesSnowpack2018, zengSnowpackChange19822018, haleDriversSpatiotemporalPatterns2023}. However, snow pillows cover less than 1~\% of the land area and are limited to mainly mid-elevation flat forest cuts \citep{guan20102011Snow2013}, and macroscale hydrologic models (e.g., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) \citep{liangSimpleHydrologicallyBased1994}) or snow reanalyses (e.g. UA daily 4~km SWE product \citep{broxtonLinkingSnowfallSnow2016}, SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) \citep{barrettNationalOperationalHydrologic2003}) have resolutions on the scale of kilometers---neither are well-suited for understanding snowpack patterns in complex topography. Therefore, the impacts of midwinter ablation are poorly constrained, with our understanding only r

% and the physical mechanisms that govern snowpack snow accumulation and ablation.
These physiographic factors impact the local energy balance dynamics, which govern the accumulation and ablation of the snowpack. 

Quantifying how these physiographic factors impact snowpack properties is highly important in understand the spatiotemporal complexities, however, this remains a relatively under studied field. \cite{musselmanWinterMeltTrends2021} notes the importance of understanding physiographic relationships of snowpack metrics and climatology; therefore, allowing a grasp of how these areas will change (***rework***). \cite{pomeroyVariationSurfaceEnergetics2003} used in situ meteorologic instrumentation setup slope normal, instead of the traditional gravimetric orientation, and found marked differences in incoming shortwave radiation (SW$_{in}$) and ablation rates on south and north facing slopes (**rework**).
-paragraph on snowpack metrics: what are they, why are they important, cite (Nolin et al., 2021)

Previous studies characterized snowpack metrics with respect to physiography. \cite{trujilloSnowpackRegimesWestern2014} used SNOTEL data over the WUS to quantify specific snowpack regimes. \citep{tennantRegionalSensitivitiesSeasonal2017, molotchEcohydrologicalControlsSnowmelt2009} 

 - What is our, “In this study we…” statement?? \

To better understand how snowpack will react to warming temperatures, we must quantify the physiographic controls on hydrologically important snowpack metrics. Here, we utilize the Sierra Nevada Snow Reanalysis (SNSR), a 90~m spatiotemporally continuous SWE data set from 1985–2016 (32 years), for a comparison of how snowpack metrics change with physiography, specifically aspect and elevation. We analyze four snowpack metrics: max SWE (MSWE), day of max SWE (DOM), fraction of snow ablation before 1 April (FM) \citep{musselmanWinterMeltTrends2021}, and midwinter ablation mount of snow ablation (MWA) (\citep{harpoldHumidityDeterminesSnowpack2018}. We then quantify the physiogrpahic controls across three basins and perform a sensitivity analysis to against meterologic forcings. 

compare these metrics against annual temperature and a clear sky shortwave radiation (herein SWin) and perform a Spearman’s Rho (SR) (Yue et al., 2002).

NEW THOUGHTS
The magnitude of insolation absorbed at the snow surface is a function of various physical factors. Aspect is a first-order control and the directness and total magnitude of insolation received in a given area. Thus, impacts the snow albedo, with south facing slopes having recieve more insolation a lower albedo***. The type and density of vegetation overlaying the snow surface can significantly impact the amount of insolation received at the snow surface (cite roth) canopy, with dense conifers shading nearly all incoming radiation. The energy input and hydrologic variabilty between aspects inturn effect vegetation (webb et al. 2023), soil moist  and  These differences vary temporally with seasons as the solar declines and inclines, the with the winter months having the most marked differences and radiative inputs.


Canopy cover variations, from either disturbance or management, was not specifically addressed in the SNSR modeling framework.

\hypertarget{ch2-sa}{\section{Study Area}\label{ch2-sa}}

We choose three distinct river basins to analyze: the Yuba, Upper San Joaquin (USJ), and the Kern. These basins were selected as they display a variety of different latitudes, hydroclimatology, forest cover, and elevation ranges ***. The basins were segmented into five elevation zones (EZs): EZ1 (1500--1900~m), EZ2 (1900--2300~m), EZ3 (2300--2700~m), EZ4 (2700--3100~m), and EZ5(3100--4361~m). EZ1--4 are split into even 400-m segments, while EZ5 extends from 3100~m to the maximum elevation (4361~m). EZ5 was chosen to be larger to simplify our results, as we found that areas above 3100~m exhibited similar snow metric characteristics. 

The basins were then segmented in north facing (315--45$^{\circ}$) and south facing (135--215$^{\circ}$) aspects, with a least a slope of > 4$^{\circ}$ needed to be considered in our analysis. By setting this slope threshold, we ensure that only complex mountain terrain, and flatter areas. The north south

In this section we describe the data products used in this study.

%==============================================================================
\hypertarget{ch2-do-2}{\subsubsection{SNSR}\label{ch2-do-2}}


The Sierra Nevada SWE Reanalysis (SNSR) \citep{margulisLandsatEraSierraNevada2016} is a 90~m gridded daily SWE product for California Sierra Nevada from water year (WY) 1985--2016. These data were created using a Bayesian particle batch smoother data assimilation (DA) technique to retroactively assimilate Landsat fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) with downscaled National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) meteorologic forcing. The MSWE estimates were validated with over 9000 years of snow pillow and snow course data. Detailed information on the development and implementation of this methodology can be found in a series of past publications: \cite{durandBayesianApproachSnow2008, girottoExaminingSpatialTemporal2014, girottoProbabilisticSWEReanalysis2014, margulisParticleBatchSmoother2015}. A recent analysis from \citep{yangIntercomparisonSnowWater2023} evaluated the uncertainty of various SWE products using ASO lidar data. They found that the SNSR performed the best according to various error metrics, making it a well-suited dataset for our analysis.

\hypertarget{ch2-do-2}{\subsubsection{SNOTEL data}\label{ch2-do-2}}

We used snow pillow data form 29....

\hypertarget{ch2-do-2}{\subsubsection{gridMET Data}\label{ch2-do-2}}

We used 4~km meteorological data from gridMET \citep{abatzoglouDevelopmentGriddedSurface2013} to calculate annual (1985--2016) cold season values from October 1 to March 31 (ONDJFM) for four meteorologic variables: mean temperature(T\textsubscript{mean}), relative humidity (RH\textsubscript{mean}), incoming solar radiation (insolation), absolute humidity (AH). Daily ONDJFM where averaged to create the annual metrics. These data were bilinearly downscaled to the 90 m SNSR resolution.Since gridMET does not include a T\textsubscript{mean} or RH\textsubscript{mean} value, only the daily maximum and minimum, these values were averaged to create the two mean variables. Insolation from gridMET is estimated with respect to a planar surface and not topographically corrected. AH in g~cm$^{-3}$ was calculated using T\textsubscript{mean}, RH\textsubscript{mean}, and a function based off the ideal gas law:

\begin{equation}
\text{AH} = \frac{{6.112 \times e^{\left(\frac{{17.67 \times \text{T}\textsubscript{mean}}}{{\text{T}\textsubscript{mean} + 243.5}} \right)} \times \text{RH}\textsubscript{mean} \times 2.1674}} {{273.15 + \text{T}\textsubscript{mean}}}
\label{eq:ah}
\end{equation}


%==============================================================================
\hypertarget{ch2-do-2}{\subsubsection{Clear sky insolation}\label{ch2-do-2}}


We estimated 90~m spatially distributed mean ONDJFM clear sky incoming solar radiation (CS insolation) using the R package “insol”, which is based on the Bird model \citep{birdReviewEvaluationImprovement1981}. The model uses the SNSR 90 m DEM as input and accounts for slope, aspect, differential shading, day of year, solar zenith angle, air temperature, elevation, and relative humidity. We held these values constant, with information on the specific model parametrization included in the supplement***. To calculate CS insolation the daily values were averaged in the same fashion as the gridMET data. This produced a single estimate not a time series like gridMET data.

\label{kuy_study_area}
\end{figure*}

Using the SNSR, we generated four pixel-wise snowpack metrics: MSWE, DOM, FM, and MWA. MSWE is defined as the maximum amount (mm) of SWE in a given pixel for WY, while DOM is the last day of water year which the pixel has the amount. FM is the fraction of ablation (melt, wind transport, sublimation) that occurs before April 1st, while MWA is the amount of SWE lost in (mm). Reporting both FM and MWA allows for a more complete understanding of midwinter melt dynamics, as gives two different values to melt across the landscape (***rework***).

We focused on our analysis on the seasonal snow zone, or areas that receive snow that majority of years. To do this, an annual accumulation threshold of 26~mm ($\sim$1~in) was of SWE for a given pixel to be considered. Then, within the 32-year time series, a pixel must meet this condition at least 27 of the 32 years. ***See Appendix 1 for figures showing the full SNSR study area***. 

SNSR values were selected by the specific pixel in which the station fell. These metrics were then validated against 29 SNOTEL stations totaling $\sim$840 station years (Figure \ref{kuy_study_area}). Two correlation coefficients (R and R$^{2}$), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), and percent bias (PB) are in Table \ref{tab:snow_metrics_val_table}.

\hypertarget{ch2-methods-2}{\subsection{Physiographic disaggregation}\label{ch2-methods-2}}

We disaggregated the basins by their physiographic characteristics (elevation, slope, and aspect) in order to understand the relationship between these physical attributes, snow metrics, and climate. This segmenting also controls for precipitation inputs, where we assume that snowfall amounts are relatively constant throughout the EZs. The basins were segmented into five elevation zones (EZs): EZ1 (1500--1900~m), EZ2 (1900--2300~m), EZ3 (2300--2700~m), EZ4 (2700--3100~m), and EZ5 (3100--4361~m). EZ1--4 are split into even 400-m segments, while EZ5 extends from 3100~m to the maximum elevation (4361~m). EZ5 was chosen to be larger to simplify our results, as we found that areas above 3100~m exhibited similar snow metric characteristics. 

The basins were then segmented in north facing (315--45$^{\circ}$) and south facing (135--215$^{\circ}$) aspects, with a least a slope of > 4$^{\circ}$ needed to be considered in our analysis. By setting this slope threshold, we focus our analysis on only complex mountain terrain and flatter areas which still technically have aspect value. We did not include east facing and west facing slopes in this study, as our focus is on the variations in direct insolation between north and south facing slopes

\hypertarget{ch2-methods-3}{\subsection{Spearman correlations}\label{ch2-methods-3}}

Spearman's Rho, a non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between variables, was computed to assess the relationship between FM and the three meteorological variables across the EZs and three study basins. The goal of this analysis was to characterize the snow metric sensitivity to the meteorologic data. The analysis was conducted on a pixel-wise basis for the 32-year study period, with each pixel producing p and Spearman's $\rho$ values. As there are $\sim$10$^4$ pixels in each elevation zone, we calculated the percentage of pixels that displayed significant trends ($p < .05$).

The four snowpack metrics varied significantly with patterns emerging with respect to basin, elevation, and aspect. The mean values---split into north and south facing slopes and EZs---for the four snow metrics are displayed in Table \ref{tab:snow_metric_table} and the boxplots showing the distribution in Fig.\ref{fig:snow_boxplots}. We also report the physiographic distribution of the four meteorologic variables in Table \ref{tab:met_metric_table} and Fig. \ref{fig:met_boxplots}.

The data are grouped by the five EZs and colored the three basins: Kern (gray), USJ (orange), Yuba (green). The colors shading represents north facing (darker) and south facing (lighter) slopes for the respective basin.}
\label{fig:snow_boxplots}
\end{figure*}


For all of the snow metrics in all three basins, there are marked differences between the north and south facing slopes (Fig.~\ref{fig:snow_boxplots}. Overall the Kern, which is the southern most basin, has the greatest mean FM values (Fig.~\ref{fig:snow_boxplots}a) for all elevation bands when compared to the Yuba and the USJ. Additionally, it had the highest mean FM percent difference between south and north facing slopes of 69.6~\%. Yet, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:met_boxplots} and Table \ref{tab:met_metric_table}, the Kern has either similar or colder T\textsubscript{mean} values (Fig. \ref{fig:met_boxplots}a) than the Yuba and the USJ. These differences are possibly explained by the insolation values in the Kern (Fig. \ref{fig:snow_boxplots}c) being greater by $\sim$15--25 $\mathrm{W~m}^{-2}$ across all EZs. Elevation trends are consistently observed across all three basins for each of the four metrics, although the magnitude of the differences varies incongruently among the basins. As expected, MSWE and DOM increase with elevation, while FM and MWA broadly decrease. The two midwinter ablation metrics (FM and MWA) impact both MSWE and DOM for all basins and EZs. Across the three basins, south facing slopes reach DOM 16.1~d earlier, with the greatest mean difference of 25 d occuring in the USJ between 3100--4361~m. MSWE on north facing slopes is on average 154~mm greater across all basins and EZs. North vs. south facing disparities are amplified by increasing elevation, with a maximum difference of 467~mm in EZ4 of the Yuba.

For EZ4 (2700--3100~m) and EZ5 (3100--4361~m), the USJ and Kern showed particularly stark differences in both midwinter ablation metrics with respect to aspect. The mean FM and MWA values for the two basins in these elevation zones on north facing slopes were 0.07 and 39~mm, respectively. In contrast, south facing slopes had markedly higher values, with mean FM and MWA values of 0.29 and 151~mm. This means there is approximately 4 times more FM and MWA on south facing slopes at elevations above 3100~m. Furthermore, the T\textsubscript{mean} values are below 0$^{\circ}$ for these errors. This suggests insolation as a driving factor in midwinter ablation.


For the gridMET derived metrics (T\textsubscript{mean}, RH***, insolation) there are no significant difference between the north facing and south facing slopes (Figure \ref{fig:met_boxplots}.a--c). This makes sense considering griMET's native 4~km spatial resolution, thus not capturing the topographic heterogeneity of the 90~m SNSR data. CS insolation shows vast differences in the amount insolation received by the two aspects. Across all basins and EZs, south facing slopes have a mean daily value of 234 $\mathrm{W~m}^{-2}$, while north facing's is 43 $\mathrm{W~m}^{-2}$. Since these are static clear sky estimates, the values say consistent across the three study basins and EZs.

Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_map} displays the results of our Spearman correlations between FM on north and south facing slopes and three meteorological variables: T\textsubscript{mean}, RH, and insolation. Overall, FM in the Yuba is highly sensitive to the three variables tested on both south facing slopes in all EZs. For the three lowest EZs, spanning 1500--3100~m, a minimum of 90~\% of the land area shows significant relationships between FM and T\textsubscript{mean}. 

The Kern and the USJ display similar patterns for the various correlations; therefore, we group these basins together when reporting their results below. For the top two EZs (2700--4361~m) in the Kern and USJ, the T\textsubscript{mean} sensitivity on north and south facing slopes diverges. Seen on the right side of Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_map}, the USJ and Kern have a mean of 14.5~\% of the area that is temperature sensitive, while south facing slopes show a markedly greater mean value of 70~\%. In contrast, this relationship reverses for the EZ1 and EZ2, where north facing slopes have a greater mean sensitive area (96~\%) while south facings slopes shows much less significance (mean of 65 \%). We note that the low percentage areas of significant relationship in EZ1--2 does not mean low FM---these areas have the largest mean FM values of anywhere in the study---it just means the FM wasn't correlated to T\textsubscript{mean}.

Our results show substantial differences between the four snow metrics across basins and elevation bands with respect to aspect. These results show the complexity and variability of mountain snowpack even within relatively confined areas and suggest that physiographic relationship play an important roll in the physical mechanisms governing snow ablation and accumulations. However, these factors are both spatial and temporally variable. While south vs. north facing slope patterns are well-established and visible throughout many mountain ranges across the globe, our study is the first the quantify the variations in accumulation season snow dynamics across various basins in a socioeconomic important mountain region.


-paragraph on temperature variation \citep{kapnickCausesRecentChanges2012}

- paragraph on forest management The findings presented here show the importance 


At lower elevations warmer temps increase the rate of snow metamorphism (grain growth), increase temp gradients within snowpack (and snowpack and atm), and further increase rate. (Colbeck, Jennings). 

Larger grain size amplifies the absorption of shorwate (wiscomb and warren, 1980, warren 1980). Midwinter ablation increases the concentration of any light absorbing impurities that may be on the surface (hatchet, gleason, skiles/painter). Hatchet et al. document the increase frequence and length of mid winter dry spells in the sierras. 

It's important to note the impacts of forest structure on the energy balance and, therefore snowpack dynamics \citep{rothForestImpactsSnow2017}. Aspect is a key control of incoming radiation, thus impacting the ecohydrological composition of a hill slope, and, therefore the snowpack energy balance. As shown by our CS insolation model south facing areas receive vastly more direct solar radiation, causing more evaporation and sublimation at both the soil and snow surfaces, impacting plant available water, and therefore decreasing both the type and density of vegetation of south facing slopes (zapata). Less overlaying vegetation causes more insolation to interacting with the snow surface, and explains why. Whereas northing slopes have dense vegetation, obsturcuting much of the insolation, and therefore shield north facing slopes to significant winter ablation. At the forest gap scale, these same north vs. south gap patterns are also seen (mussleman 2012, webb 2020)


While not specifically paramterized*** in the SNSR, wind transport can substaintally affect the distrubitoin of snowpack. (cite winstal, marks, and such) Depending on the pervailing wind direction (westerly in the sierra), lee facing slopes tend to have. This 



While the course scale of the meteorological data does not capture complex microclimates, previous works suggest that temperatures is warmer on south facing aspects (lundsquist). - look at all the lundquist temp studies in the sierra



%% radiation thoughts
The gridMET SRAD data shows both an elevational and latiditunal gradident in values. Our CS insolation model does not account for these variations, and would likely amplify the findings presented here.-paragraph on longwave and shortwave variation in a warming climate, ***there has been work that suggest SW may derecases as cloudover inceases***

-pomeroy (2009) long wave effects on cannopy

However, the SNSR doesn’t directly address the secondary radiative forcing, therefore we effect of aspect on snowmelt processes would be amplified.
